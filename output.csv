1,Network model of skeletal muscle cell signalling predicts differential responses to endurance and resistance exercise training.,"Exercise-induced muscle adaptations vary based on exercise modality and intensity. We constructed a signalling network model from 87 published studies of human or rodent skeletal muscle cell responses to endurance or resistance exercise in vivo or simulated exercise in vitro. The network comprises 259 signalling interactions between 120 nodes, representing eight membrane receptors and eight canonical signalling pathways regulating 14 transcriptional regulators, 28 target genes and 12 exercise-induced phenotypes. Using this network, we formulated a logic-based ordinary differential equation model predicting time-dependent molecular and phenotypic alterations following acute endurance and resistance exercises. Compared with nine independent studies, the model accurately predicted 18/21 (85%) acute responses to resistance exercise and 12/16 (75%) acute responses to endurance exercise. Detailed sensitivity analysis of differential phenotypic responses to resistance and endurance training showed that, in the model, exercise regulates cell growth and protein synthesis primarily by signalling via mechanistic target of rapamycin, which is activated by Akt and inhibited in endurance exercise by AMP-activated protein kinase. Endurance exercise preferentially activates inflammation via reactive oxygen species and nuclear factor κB signalling. Furthermore, the expected preferential activation of mitochondrial biogenesis by endurance exercise was counterbalanced in the model by protein kinase C in response to resistance training. This model provides a new tool for investigating cross-talk between skeletal muscle signalling pathways activated by endurance and resistance exercise, and the mechanisms of interactions such as the interference effects of endurance training on resistance exercise outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643471/,exerciseinduced muscle adaptation vary based exercise modality intensity constructed signalling network model published study human rodent skeletal muscle cell response endurance resistance exercise vivo simulated exercise vitro network comprises signalling interaction node representing eight membrane receptor eight canonical signalling pathway regulating transcriptional regulator target gene exerciseinduced phenotype using network formulated logicbased ordinary differential equation model predicting timedependent molecular phenotypic alteration following acute endurance resistance exercise compared nine independent study model accurately predicted acute response resistance exercise acute response endurance exercise detailed sensitivity analysis differential phenotypic response resistance endurance training showed model exercise regulates cell growth protein synthesis primarily signalling via mechanistic target rapamycin activated akt inhibited endurance exercise ampactivated protein kinase endurance exercise preferentially activates inflammation via reactive oxygen specie nuclear factor b signalling furthermore expected preferential activation mitochondrial biogenesis endurance exercise counterbalanced model protein kinase c response resistance training model provides new tool investigating crosstalk skeletal muscle signalling pathway activated endurance resistance exercise mechanism interaction interference effect endurance training resistance exercise outcome

6,Improving the production of carbamoyltobramycin by an industrial Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius through metabolic engineering.,"Tobramycin is an essential and extensively used broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic obtained through alkaline hydrolysis of carbamoyltobramycin, one of the fermentation products of Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius. To simplify the composition of fermentation products from industrial strain, the main byproduct apramycin was blocked by gene disruption and constructed a mutant mainly producing carbamoyltobramycin. The generation of antibiotics is significantly affected by the secondary metabolism of actinomycetes which could be controlled by modifying the pathway-specific regulatory proteins within the cluster. Within the tobramycin biosynthesis cluster, a transcriptional regulatory factor TobR belonging to the Lrp/AsnC family was identified. Based on the sequence and structural characteristics, tobR might encode a pathway-specific transcriptional regulatory factor during biosynthesis. Knockout and overexpression strains of tobR were constructed to investigate its role in carbamoyltobramycin production. Results showed that knockout of TobR increased carbamoyltobramycin biosynthesis by 22.35%, whereas its overexpression decreased carbamoyltobramycin production by 10.23%. In vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments confirmed that TobR interacts with DNA at the adjacent tobO promoter position. Strains overexpressing tobO with ermEp* promoter exhibited 36.36% increase, and tobO with kasOp* promoter exhibited 22.84% increase in carbamoyltobramycin titer. When the overexpressing of tobO and the knockout of tobR were combined, the production of carbamoyltobramycin was further enhanced. In the shake-flask fermentation, the titer reached 3.76 g/L, which was 42.42% higher than that of starting strain. Understanding the role of Lrp/AsnC family transcription regulators would be useful for other antibiotic biosynthesis in other actinomycetes.

7,"Kurarinone, a flavonoid from Radix Sophorae Flavescentis, inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in mouse bone marrow-derived monocyte/macrophages.","Inflammation-induced osteoclast proliferation is a crucial contributor to impaired bone metabolism. Kurarinone (KR), a flavonoid extracted from the Radix Sophorae Flavescentis, exhibits notable anti-inflammatory properties. Nevertheless, the precise influence of KR on osteoclast formation remains unclear. This study's objective was to assess the impact of KR on osteoclast activity in vitro and unravel its underlying mechanism. Initially, a target network for KR-osteoclastogenesis-osteoporosis was constructed using network pharmacology. Subsequently, the intersecting targets were identified through the Venny platform and a PPI network was created using Cytoscape 3.9.1. Key targets within the network were identified employing topological algorithms. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis were then performed on these targets to explore their specific functions and pathways. Additionally, molecular docking of potential core targets of KR was conducted, and the results were validated through cell experiments. A total of 83 target genes overlapped between KR and osteoclastogenesis-osteoporosis targets. Enrichment analysis revealed their role in inflammatory response, protein tyrosine kinase activity, osteoclast differentiation, and MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. PPI analysis and molecular docking demonstrate that key targets MAPK14 and MAPK8 exhibit more stable binding with KR compared to other proteins. In vitro experiments demonstrate that KR effectively inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption without cellular toxicity. It suppresses key osteoclast genes (NFATc1, c-Fos, TRAP, MMP9, Ctsk, Atp6v2), hinders IκB-α degradation, and inhibits ERK and JNK phosphorylation, while not affecting p38 phosphorylation. The results indicate that KR may inhibit osteoclast maturation and bone resorption by blocking NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways, suggesting its potential as a natural therapeutic agent for osteoporosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643449/,inflammationinduced osteoclast proliferation crucial contributor impaired bone metabolism kurarinone kr flavonoid extracted radix sophorae flavescentis exhibit notable antiinflammatory property nevertheless precise influence kr osteoclast formation remains unclear study objective ass impact kr osteoclast activity vitro unravel underlying mechanism initially target network krosteoclastogenesisosteoporosis constructed using network pharmacology subsequently intersecting target identified venny platform ppi network created using cytoscape key target within network identified employing topological algorithm go enrichment kegg pathway analysis performed target explore specific function pathway additionally molecular docking potential core target kr conducted result validated cell experiment total target gene overlapped kr osteoclastogenesisosteoporosis target enrichment analysis revealed role inflammatory response protein tyrosine kinase activity osteoclast differentiation mapk nfb signaling pathway ppi analysis molecular docking demonstrate key target mapk mapk exhibit stable binding kr compared protein vitro experiment demonstrate kr effectively inhibits osteoclast differentiation bone resorption without cellular toxicity suppresses key osteoclast gene nfatc cfo trap mmp ctsk atpv hinders ib degradation inhibits erk jnk phosphorylation affecting p phosphorylation result indicate kr may inhibit osteoclast maturation bone resorption blocking nfb mapk signaling pathway suggesting potential natural therapeutic agent osteoporosis
8,Adipose-derived stem cells promote glycolysis and peritoneal metastasis via TGF-β1/SMAD3/ANGPTL4 axis in colorectal cancer.,"Peritoneal metastasis, the third most common metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC), has a poor prognosis for the rapid progression and limited therapeutic strategy. However, the molecular characteristics and pathogenesis of CRC peritoneal metastasis are poorly understood. Here, we aimed to elucidate the action and mechanism of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), a prominent component of the peritoneal microenvironment, in CRC peritoneal metastasis formation. Database analysis indicated that ADSCs infiltration was increased in CRC peritoneal metastases, and high expression levels of ADSCs marker genes predicted a poor prognosis. Then we investigated the effect of ADSCs on CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. The results revealed that CRC cells co-cultured with ADSCs exhibited stronger metastatic property and anoikis resistance, and ADSCs boosted the intraperitoneal seeding of CRC cells. Furthermore, RNA sequencing was carried out to identify the key target gene, angiopoietin like 4 (ANGPTL4), which was upregulated in CRC specimens, especially in peritoneal metastases. Mechanistically, TGF-β1 secreted by ADSCs activated SMAD3 in CRC cells, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that SMAD3 facilitated ANGPTL4 transcription by directly binding to ANGPTL4 promoter. The ANGPTL4 upregulation was essential for ADSCs to promote glycolysis and anoikis resistance in CRC. Importantly, simultaneously targeting TGF-β signaling and ANGPTL4 efficiently reduced intraperitoneal seeding in vivo. In conclusion, this study indicates that tumor-infiltrating ADSCs promote glycolysis and anoikis resistance in CRC cells and ultimately facilitate peritoneal metastasis via the TGF-β1/SMAD3/ANGPTL4 axis. The dual-targeting of TGF-β signaling and ANGPTL4 may be a feasible therapeutic strategy for CRC peritoneal metastasis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643448/,peritoneal metastasis third common metastasis colorectal cancer crc poor prognosis rapid progression limited therapeutic strategy however molecular characteristic pathogenesis crc peritoneal metastasis poorly understood aimed elucidate action mechanism adiposederived stem cell adscs prominent component peritoneal microenvironment crc peritoneal metastasis formation database analysis indicated adscs infiltration increased crc peritoneal metastasis high expression level adscs marker gene predicted poor prognosis investigated effect adscs crc cell vitro vivo result revealed crc cell cocultured adscs exhibited stronger metastatic property anoikis resistance adscs boosted intraperitoneal seeding crc cell furthermore rna sequencing carried identify key target gene angiopoietin like angptl upregulated crc specimen especially peritoneal metastasis mechanistically tgf secreted adscs activated smad crc cell chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed smad facilitated angptl transcription directly binding angptl promoter angptl upregulation essential adscs promote glycolysis anoikis resistance crc importantly simultaneously targeting tgf signaling angptl efficiently reduced intraperitoneal seeding vivo conclusion study indicates tumorinfiltrating adscs promote glycolysis anoikis resistance crc cell ultimately facilitate peritoneal metastasis via tgfsmadangptl axis dualtargeting tgf signaling angptl may feasible therapeutic strategy crc peritoneal metastasis

21,Toxicogenomics of Five Cytostatics in Fathead Minnow (Pimephales promelas) Larvae.,"In this study, the toxicogenomic effects of five cytostatics (tamoxifen, methotrexate, capecitabine, cyclophosphamide, and ifosfamide) on fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) larvae were evaluated. Post-fertilization eggs were exposed to increasing concentrations of the drugs for six days. The expression levels of two genetic biomarkers for toxicity and four thyroid hormone-related gene pathways were measured. Interestingly, the results showed that all concentrations of the five cytostatics affect the transcription levels of both toxicity biomarker genes. Additionally, the thyroid hormone-related genes had different expression levels than the control, with the most significant changes observed in those larvae exposed to cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide.

22,Absence of E2f1 Negates Pro-osteogenic Impacts of p21 Absence.,"Loss of p21 leads to increased bone formation post-injury; however, the mechanism(s) by which this occurs remains undetermined. E2f1 is downstream of p21 and as a transcription factor can act directly on gene expression; yet it is unknown if E2f1 plays a role in the osteogenic effects observed when p21 is differentially regulated. In this study we aimed to investigate the interplay between p21 and E2f1 and determine if the pro-regenerative osteogenic effects observed with the loss of p21 are E2f1 dependent. To accomplish this, we employed knockout p21 and E2f1 mice and additionally generated a p21/E2f1 double knockout.

26,Navigating therapeutic strategies: HPV classification in head and neck cancer.,"The World Health Organisation recognised human papillomavirus (HPV) as the cause of multiple cancers, including head and neck cancers. HPV is a double-stranded DNA virus, and its viral gene expression can be controlled after infection by cellular and viral promoters. In cancer cells, the HPV genome is detected as either integrated into the host genome, episomal (extrachromosomal), or a mixture of integrated and episomal. Viral integration requires the breakage of both viral and host DNA, and the integration rate correlates with the level of DNA damage. Interestingly, patients with HPV-positive head and neck cancers generally have a good prognosis except for a group of patients with fully integrated HPV who show worst clinical outcomes. Those patients present with lowered expression of viral genes and limited infiltration of cytotoxic T cells. An impediment to effective therapy applications in the clinic is the sole testing for HPV positivity without considering the HPV integration status. This review will discuss HPV integration as a potential determinant of response to therapies in head and neck cancers and highlight to the field a novel therapeutic avenue that would reduce the cancer burden and improve patient survival.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643337/,world health organisation recognised human papillomavirus hpv cause multiple cancer including head neck cancer hpv doublestranded dna virus viral gene expression controlled infection cellular viral promoter cancer cell hpv genome detected either integrated host genome episomal extrachromosomal mixture integrated episomal viral integration requires breakage viral host dna integration rate correlate level dna damage interestingly patient hpvpositive head neck cancer generally good prognosis except group patient fully integrated hpv show worst clinical outcome patient present lowered expression viral gene limited infiltration cytotoxic cell impediment effective therapy application clinic sole testing hpv positivity without considering hpv integration status review discus hpv integration potential determinant response therapy head neck cancer highlight field novel therapeutic avenue would reduce cancer burden improve patient survival
27,Peanut LEAFY COTYLEDON1-type genes participate in regulating the embryo development and the accumulation of storage lipids.,"Two peanut LEC1-type genes exhibit partial functional redundancy. AhNFYB10 could complement almost all the defective phenotypes of lec1-2 in terms of embryonic morphology, while AhNF-YB1 could partially affect these phenotypes. LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) is a member of the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) family of transcription factors and has been identified as a key regulator of embryonic development. In the present study, two LEC1-type genes from Arachis hypogeae were identified and designated as AhNF-YB1 and AhNF-YB10; these genes belong to subgenome A and subgenome B, respectively. The functions of AhNF-YB1 and AhNF-YB10 were investigated by complementation analysis of their defective phenotypes of the Arabidopsis lec1-2 mutant and by ectopic expression in wild-type Arabidopsis. The results indicated that both AhNF-YB1 and AhNF-YB10 participate in regulating embryogenesis, embryo development, and reserve deposition in cotyledons and that they have partial functional redundancy. In contrast, AhNF-YB10 complemented almost all the defective phenotypes of lec1-2 in terms of embryonic morphology and hypocotyl length, while AhNF-YB1 had only a partial effect. In addition, 30-40% of the seeds of the AhNF-YB1 transformants exhibited a decreasing germination ratio and longevity. Therefore, appropriate spatiotemporal expression of these genes is necessary for embryo morphogenesis at the early development stage and is responsible for seed maturation at the mid-late development stage. On the other hand, overexpression of AhNF-YB1 or AhNF-YB10 at the middle to late stages of Arabidopsis seed development improved the weight, oil content, and fatty acid composition of the transgenic seeds. Moreover, the expression levels of several genes associated with fatty acid synthesis and embryogenesis were significantly greater in developing AhNF-YB10-overexpressing seeds than in control seeds. This study provides a theoretical basis for breeding oilseed crops with high yields and high oil content.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643320/,two peanut lectype gene exhibit partial functional redundancy ahnfyb could complement almost defective phenotype lec term embryonic morphology ahnfyb could partially affect phenotype leafy cotyledon lec member nuclear factor nfy family transcription factor identified key regulator embryonic development present study two lectype gene arachis hypogeae identified designated ahnfyb ahnfyb gene belong subgenome subgenome b respectively function ahnfyb ahnfyb investigated complementation analysis defective phenotype arabidopsis lec mutant ectopic expression wildtype arabidopsis result indicated ahnfyb ahnfyb participate regulating embryogenesis embryo development reserve deposition cotyledon partial functional redundancy contrast ahnfyb complemented almost defective phenotype lec term embryonic morphology hypocotyl length ahnfyb partial effect addition seed ahnfyb transformants exhibited decreasing germination ratio longevity therefore appropriate spatiotemporal expression gene necessary embryo morphogenesis early development stage responsible seed maturation midlate development stage hand overexpression ahnfyb ahnfyb middle late stage arabidopsis seed development improved weight oil content fatty acid composition transgenic seed moreover expression level several gene associated fatty acid synthesis embryogenesis significantly greater developing ahnfyboverexpressing seed control seed study provides theoretical basis breeding oilseed crop high yield high oil content
28,Haemostatic gene variations in cervical cancer-associated venous thrombosis: considerations for clinical strategies.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a life-threatening haemostatic disease frequently diagnosed among the cancer population. The Khorana Score is currently the primal risk assessment model to stratify oncological patients according to their susceptibility to VTE, however, it displays a limited performance. Meanwhile, intensive research on VTE pathophysiology in the general population has uncovered a range of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the condition. Nonetheless, their predictive ability concerning cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) is controversial. Cervical cancer (CC) patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy often experience VTE, which negatively affects their survival. Thus, aiming for an improvement in thromboprophylaxis, new thrombotic biomarkers, including SNPs, are currently under investigation. In this study, the predictive capability of haemostatic gene SNPs on CC-related VTE and their prognostic value regardless of VTE were explored. Six SNPs in haemostatic genes were evaluated. A total of 401 CC patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy were enrolled in a retrospective cohort study. The implications for the time to VTE occurrence and overall survival (OS) were assessed. CAT considerably impacted the CC patients' OS (log-rank test, P < 0.001). SERPINE1 rs2070682 (T > C) showed a significant association with the risk of CC-related VTE (CC/CT vs. TT, log-rank test, P = 0.002; C allele, Cox model, hazard ratio (HR) = 6.99 and P = 0.009), while F2 rs1799963 (G > A) demonstrated an important prognostic value regardless of VTE (AA/AG vs. GG, log-rank test, P = 0.020; A allele, Cox model, HR = 2.76 and P = 0.026). For the remaining SNPs, no significant associations were detected. The polymorphisms SERPINE1 rs2070682 and F2 rs1799963 could be valuable tools in clinical decision-making, aiding in thromboprophylaxis and CC management, respectively.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643313/,venous thromboembolism vte lifethreatening haemostatic disease frequently diagnosed among cancer population khorana score currently primal risk assessment model stratify oncological patient according susceptibility vte however display limited performance meanwhile intensive research vte pathophysiology general population uncovered range singlenucleotide polymorphism snp associated condition nonetheless predictive ability concerning cancerassociated thrombosis cat controversial cervical cancer cc patient undergoing chemoradiotherapy often experience vte negatively affect survival thus aiming improvement thromboprophylaxis new thrombotic biomarkers including snp currently investigation study predictive capability haemostatic gene snp ccrelated vte prognostic value regardless vte explored six snp haemostatic gene evaluated total cc patient undergoing chemoradiotherapy enrolled retrospective cohort study implication time vte occurrence overall survival o assessed cat considerably impacted cc patient o logrank test p serpine r c showed significant association risk ccrelated vte ccct v tt logrank test p c allele cox model hazard ratio hr p f r g demonstrated important prognostic value regardless vte aaag v gg logrank test p allele cox model hr p remaining snp significant association detected polymorphism serpine r f r could valuable tool clinical decisionmaking aiding thromboprophylaxis cc management respectively

31,8-Cl-Ado and 8-NH,"Targeting the metabolic dependencies of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells is a promising therapeutical strategy. In particular, the cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway (C/M) is significantly altered in AML cells compared to healthy blood cells. Moreover, methionine has been identified as one of the dominant amino acid dependencies of AML cells. Through RNA-seq, we found that the two nucleoside analogs 8-chloro-adenosine (8CA) and 8-amino-adenosine (8AA) significantly suppress the C/M pathway in AML cells, and methionine-adenosyltransferase-2A (MAT2A) is one of most significantly downregulated genes. Additionally, mass spectrometry analysis revealed that Venetoclax (VEN), a BCL-2 inhibitor recently approved by the FDA for AML treatment, significantly decreases the intracellular level of methionine in AML cells. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that combining 8CA or 8AA with VEN can efficiently target the Methionine-MAT2A-S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) axis in AML. Our results demonstrate that VEN and 8CA/8AA synergistically decrease the SAM biosynthesis and effectively target AML cells both in vivo and in vitro. These findings suggest the promising potential of combining 8CA/8AA and VEN for AML treatment by inhibiting Methionine-MAT2A-SAM axis and provide a strong rationale for our recently activated clinical trial.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643304/,targeting metabolic dependency acute myeloid leukemia aml cell promising therapeutical strategy particular cysteine methionine metabolism pathway cm significantly altered aml cell compared healthy blood cell moreover methionine identified one dominant amino acid dependency aml cell rnaseq found two nucleoside analog chloroadenosine ca aminoadenosine aa significantly suppress cm pathway aml cell methionineadenosyltransferasea mata one significantly downregulated gene additionally mass spectrometry analysis revealed venetoclax ven bcl inhibitor recently approved fda aml treatment significantly decrease intracellular level methionine aml cell based finding hypothesized combining ca aa ven efficiently target methioninematasadenosylmethionine sam axis aml result demonstrate ven caaa synergistically decrease sam biosynthesis effectively target aml cell vivo vitro finding suggest promising potential combining caaa ven aml treatment inhibiting methioninematasam axis provide strong rationale recently activated clinical trial
32,NET-related gene signature for predicting AML prognosis.,"Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a malignant blood cancer with a high mortality rate. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) influence various tumor outcomes. However, NET-related genes (NRGs) in AML had not yet received much attention. This study focuses on the role of NRGs in AML and their interaction with the immunological microenvironment. The gene expression and clinical data of patients with AML were downloaded from the TCGA-LAML and GEO cohorts. We identified 148 NRGs through the published article. Univariate Cox regression was used to analyze the association of NRGs with overall survival (OS). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were utilized to assess the predictive efficacy of NRGs. Kaplan-Meier plots visualized survival estimates. ROC curves assessed the prognostic value of NRG-based features. A nomogram, integrating clinical information and prognostic scores of patients, was constructed using multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression models. Twenty-seven NRGs were found to significantly impact patient OS. Six NRGs-CFTR, ENO1, PARVB, DDIT4, MPO, LDLR-were notable for their strong predictive ability regarding patient survival. The ROC values for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 0.794, 0.781, and 0.911, respectively. In the training set (TCGA-LAML), patients in the high NRG risk group showed a poorer prognosis (p < 0.001), which was validated in two external datasets (GSE71014 and GSE106291). The 6-NRG signature and corresponding nomograms exhibit superior predictive accuracy, offering insights for pre-immune response evaluation and guiding future immuno-oncology treatments and drug selection for AML patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643300/,acute myeloid leukemia aml malignant blood cancer high mortality rate neutrophil extracellular trap net influence various tumor outcome however netrelated gene nrgs aml yet received much attention study focus role nrgs aml interaction immunological microenvironment gene expression clinical data patient aml downloaded tcgalaml geo cohort identified nrgs published article univariate cox regression used analyze association nrgs overall survival o least absolute shrinkage selection operator utilized ass predictive efficacy nrgs kaplanmeier plot visualized survival estimate roc curve assessed prognostic value nrgbased feature nomogram integrating clinical information prognostic score patient constructed using multivariate logistic regression cox proportional hazard regression model twentyseven nrgs found significantly impact patient o six nrgscftr eno parvb ddit mpo ldlrwere notable strong predictive ability regarding patient survival roc value year survival rate respectively training set tcgalaml patient high nrg risk group showed poorer prognosis p validated two external datasets gse gse nrg signature corresponding nomogram exhibit superior predictive accuracy offering insight preimmune response evaluation guiding future immunooncology treatment drug selection aml patient

34,Chromosome-level genome assembly of marine diatom Skeletonema tropicum.,"Skeletonema tropicum is a marine diatom of the genus Skeletonema that also includes many well-known species including S. marinoi. S. tropicum is a high temperature preferring species thriving in tropical ocean regions or temperate ocean regions during summer-autumn. However, mechanisms of ecological adaptation of S. tropicum remain poorly understood due partially to the lack of a high-quality whole genome assembly. Here, we report the first high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly for S. tropicum, using cutting-edge technologies including PacBio single molecular sequencing and high-throughput chromatin conformation capture. The assembled genome has a size of 78.78 Mb with a scaffold N50 of 3.17 Mb, anchored to 23 pseudo-chromosomes. In total, 20,613 protein-coding genes were predicted, of which 17,757 (86.14%) genes were functionally annotated. Collinearity analysis of the genomes of S. tropicum and S. marinoi revealed that these two genomes were highly homologous.

35,Spontaneous Akt2 deficiency in a colony of NOD mice exhibiting early diabetes.,"Diabetes constitutes a major public health problem, with dramatic consequences for patients. Both genetic and environmental factors were shown to contribute to the different forms of the disease. The monogenic forms, found both in humans and in animal models, specially help to decipher the role of key genes in the physiopathology of the disease. Here, we describe the phenotype of early diabetes in a colony of NOD mice, with spontaneous invalidation of Akt2, that we called HYP. The HYP mice were characterised by a strong and chronic hyperglycaemia, beginning around the age of one month, especially in male mice. The phenotype was not the consequence of the acceleration of the autoimmune response, inherent to the NOD background. Interestingly, in HYP mice, we observed hyperinsulinemia before hyperglycaemia occurred. We did not find any difference in the pancreas' architecture of the NOD and HYP mice (islets' size and staining for insulin and glucagon) but we detected a lower insulin content in the pancreas of HYP mice compared to NOD mice. These results give new insights about the role played by Akt2 in glucose homeostasis and argue for the ß cell failure being the primary event in the course of diabetes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643275/,diabetes constitutes major public health problem dramatic consequence patient genetic environmental factor shown contribute different form disease monogenic form found human animal model specially help decipher role key gene physiopathology disease describe phenotype early diabetes colony nod mouse spontaneous invalidation akt called hyp hyp mouse characterised strong chronic hyperglycaemia beginning around age one month especially male mouse phenotype consequence acceleration autoimmune response inherent nod background interestingly hyp mouse observed hyperinsulinemia hyperglycaemia occurred find difference pancreas architecture nod hyp mouse islet size staining insulin glucagon detected lower insulin content pancreas hyp mouse compared nod mouse result give new insight role played akt glucose homeostasis argue cell failure primary event course diabetes
36,Integrative analysis in head and neck cancer reveals distinct role of miRNome and methylome as tumour epigenetic drivers.,"Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide, with the relatively low 5-year survival rate, mainly because it is diagnosed at a late stage. Infection with HPV is a well known aetiology, which affects the nature of these cancers and patients' survival. Besides, it is considered that the main driving force for this type of cancer could be epigenetics. In this study we aimed to find potential epigenetic biomarkers, by integrating miRNome, methylome, and transcriptome analyses. From the fresh head and neck cancer tissue samples, we chose a group for miRNome, methylome and transcriptome profiling, in comparison to adequate control samples. Bioinformatics analyses are performed in R v4.2.2. Count normalisation and group differential expression for mRNA and the previously obtained miRNA count data was performed with DESeq2 v1.36. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed and visualised using gProfiler2 v0.2.1 Identification of miRNA targets was performed by querying in miRTarBase using multiMiR v1.18.0. Annotation of CpG sites merging into islands was obtained from RnBeads.hg19 v1.28.0. package. For the integrative analysis we performed kmeans clustering using stats v4.2.2 package, using 8-12 clusters and nstart 100. We found that transcriptome analysis divides samples into cancers and controls clusters, with no relation to HPV status or cancer anatomical location. Differentially expressed genes (n = 2781) were predominantly associated with signalling pathways of tumour progression. We identified a cluster of genes under the control of the transcription factor E2F that are significantly underexpressed in cancer tissue, as well as T cell immunity genes and genes related to regulation of transcription. Among overexpressed genes in tumours we found those that belong to cell cycle regulation and vasculature. A small number of genes were found significantly differentially expressed in HPV-positive versus HPV-negative tumours (for example NEFH, ZFR2, TAF7L, ZNF541, and TYMS). In this comprehensive study on an overlapping set of samples where the integration of miRNome, methylome and transcriptome analysis were performed for head and neck cancer, we demonstrated that the majority of genes were associated exclusively with miRNome or methylome and, to a lesser extent, under the control of both epigenetic mechanisms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643268/,head neck cancer sixth common malignancy worldwide relatively low year survival rate mainly diagnosed late stage infection hpv well known aetiology affect nature cancer patient survival besides considered main driving force type cancer could epigenetics study aimed find potential epigenetic biomarkers integrating mirnome methylome transcriptome analysis fresh head neck cancer tissue sample chose group mirnome methylome transcriptome profiling comparison adequate control sample bioinformatics analysis performed r v count normalisation group differential expression mrna previously obtained mirna count data performed deseq v gene set enrichment analysis performed visualised using gprofiler v identification mirna target performed querying mirtarbase using multimir v annotation cpg site merging island obtained rnbeadshg v package integrative analysis performed kmeans clustering using stats v package using cluster nstart found transcriptome analysis divide sample cancer control cluster relation hpv status cancer anatomical location differentially expressed gene n predominantly associated signalling pathway tumour progression identified cluster gene control transcription factor ef significantly underexpressed cancer tissue well cell immunity gene gene related regulation transcription among overexpressed gene tumour found belong cell cycle regulation vasculature small number gene found significantly differentially expressed hpvpositive versus hpvnegative tumour example nefh zfr tafl znf tyms comprehensive study overlapping set sample integration mirnome methylome transcriptome analysis performed head neck cancer demonstrated majority gene associated exclusively mirnome methylome lesser extent control epigenetic mechanism

39,Alfalfa xeno-miR159a regulates bovine mammary epithelial cell proliferation and milk protein synthesis by targeting PTPRF.,"Milk protein content is an important index to evaluate the quality and nutrition of milk. Accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in bovine lactation, but little is known regarding the cross-kingdom regulatory roles of plant-derived exogenous miRNAs (xeno-miRNAs) in milk protein synthesis, particularly the underlying molecular mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to explore the regulatory mechanism of alfalfa-derived xeno-miRNAs on proliferation and milk protein synthesis in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs). Our previous study showed that alfalfa miR159a (mtr-miR159a, xeno-miR159a) was highly expressed in alfalfa, and the abundance of mtr-miR159a was significantly lower in serum and whey from high-protein-milk dairy cows compared with low-protein-milk dairy cows. In this study, mRNA expression was detected by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), and casein content was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected using the cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining, western blot, and flow cytometry. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to determine the regulation of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type F (PTPRF) by xeno-miR159a. We found that xeno-miR159a overexpression inhibited proliferation of BMEC and promoted cell apoptosis. Besides, xeno-miR159a overexpression decreased β-casein abundance, and increased α-casein and κ-casein abundance in BMECs. Dual-luciferase reporter assay result confirmed that PTPRF is a target gene of xeno-miR159a.

40,Detection and genomic characterization of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli harboring tet(X4) in black kites (Milvus migrans) in Pakistan.,"The emergence of plasmid-mediated tigecycline resistance gene tet(X4) among clinically relevant bacteria has promoted significant concerns, as tigecycline is considered a last-resort drug against serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. We herein focused on the isolation and molecular characterization of tet(X4)-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) in wild bird populations with anthropogenic interaction in Faisalabad, Pakistan. A total of 150 birds including black kites (Milvus migrans) and house crows (Corvus splendens) were screened for the presence of tigecycline resistance K. pneumoniae and E. coli. We found two K. pneumoniae and one E. coli isolate carrying tet(X4) originating from black kites. A combination of short- and long-read sequencing strategies showed that tet(X4) was located on a broad host range IncFII plasmid family in K. pneumoniae isolates whereas on an IncFII-IncFIB hybrid plasmid in E. coli. We also found an integrative and conjugative element ICEKp2 in K. pneumoniae isolate KP8336.

WHO screening guidelines recommend human papilloma virus (HPV) detection as a means to identify women at risk of developing cervical cancer. While HPV testing identifies those at risk, it does not specifically distinguish individuals with neoplasia.

42,"The overlooked evolutionary dynamics of 16S rRNA revises its role as the ""gold standard"" for bacterial species identification.","The role of 16S rRNA has been and largely remains crucial for the identification of microbial organisms. Although 16S rRNA could certainly be described as one of the most studied sequences ever, the current view of it remains somewhat ambiguous. While some consider 16S rRNA to be a variable marker with resolution power down to the strain level, others consider them to be living fossils that carry information about the origin of domains of cellular life. We show that 16S rRNA is clearly an evolutionarily very rigid sequence, making it a largely unique and irreplaceable marker, but its applicability beyond the genus level is highly limited. Interestingly, it seems that the evolutionary rigidity is not driven by functional constraints of the sequence (RNA-protein interactions), but rather results from the characteristics of the host organism. Our results suggest that, at least in some lineages, Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) within genera plays an important role for the evolutionary non-dynamics (stasis) of 16S rRNA. Such genera exhibit an apparent lack of diversification at the 16S rRNA level in comparison to the rest of a genome.

43,Alterations of the duodenal mucosal microbiome in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is associated with altered gut microbiota; however, there has been a focus on fecal samples, which are not representative of the entire digestive tract. Mucosal biopsies of the descending duodenum were collected. Five regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified and sequenced. Other assessments conducted on the study subjects included body mass index, transient elastography, liver enzymes, and lipid profile. Fifty-one subjects (36 with MASLD and 15 controls) were evaluated. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding alpha- or beta-diversity of the duodenal mucosal microbiota. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis showed that the genera Serratia and Aggregatibacter were more abundant in the duodenal mucosa of patients with MASLD, whereas the duodenal mucosal microbiota of the healthy controls was enriched with the genus Petrobacter. PICRUSt2 analysis revealed that genes associated with amino acid degradation and carboxylate degradation were significantly enriched in the duodenal mucosal microbiota of patients with MASLD.

44,Small GTPase Rab7 is involved in stress adaptation to carbon starvation to ensure the induced cellulase biosynthesis in Trichoderma reesei.,"The saprophytic filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei represents one of the most prolific cellulase producers. The bulk production of lignocellulolytic enzymes by T. reesei not only relies on the efficient transcription of cellulase genes but also their efficient secretion after being translated. However, little attention has been paid to the functional roles of the involved secretory pathway in the high-level production of cellulases in T. reesei. Rab GTPases are key regulators in coordinating various vesicle trafficking associated with the eukaryotic secretory pathway. Specifically, Rab7 is a representative GTPase regulating the transition of the early endosome to the late endosome followed by its fusion to the vacuole as well as homotypic vacuole fusion. Although crosstalk between the endosomal/vacuolar pathway and the secretion pathway has been reported, the functional role of Rab7 in cellulase production in T. reesei remains unknown.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643207/,saprophytic filamentous fungus trichoderma reesei represents one prolific cellulase producer bulk production lignocellulolytic enzyme reesei relies efficient transcription cellulase gene also efficient secretion translated however little attention paid functional role involved secretory pathway highlevel production cellulases reesei rab gtpases key regulator coordinating various vesicle trafficking associated eukaryotic secretory pathway specifically rab representative gtpase regulating transition early endosome late endosome followed fusion vacuole well homotypic vacuole fusion although crosstalk endosomalvacuolar pathway secretion pathway reported functional role rab cellulase production reesei remains unknown

47,N4BP1 functions as a dimerization-dependent linear ubiquitin reader which regulates TNF signalling.,"Signalling through TNFR1 modulates proinflammatory gene transcription and programmed cell death, and its impairment causes autoimmune diseases and cancer. NEDD4-binding protein 1 (N4BP1) is a critical suppressor of proinflammatory cytokine production that acts as a regulator of innate immune signalling and inflammation. However, our current understanding about the molecular properties that enable N4BP1 to exert its suppressive potential remain limited. Here, we show that N4BP1 is a novel linear ubiquitin reader that negatively regulates NFκB signalling by its unique dimerization-dependent ubiquitin-binding module that we named LUBIN. Dimeric N4BP1 strategically positions two non-selective ubiquitin-binding domains to ensure preferential recognition of linear ubiquitin. Under proinflammatory conditions, N4BP1 is recruited to the nascent TNFR1 signalling complex, where it regulates duration of proinflammatory signalling in LUBIN-dependent manner. N4BP1 deficiency accelerates TNFα-induced cell death by increasing complex II assembly. Under proapoptotic conditions, caspase-8 mediates proteolytic processing of N4BP1, resulting in rapid degradation of N4BP1 by the 26 S proteasome, and acceleration of apoptosis. In summary, our findings demonstrate that N4BP1 dimerization creates a novel type of ubiquitin reader that selectively recognises linear ubiquitin which enables the timely and coordinated regulation of TNFR1-mediated inflammation and cell death.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643192/,signalling tnfr modulates proinflammatory gene transcription programmed cell death impairment cause autoimmune disease cancer neddbinding protein nbp critical suppressor proinflammatory cytokine production act regulator innate immune signalling inflammation however current understanding molecular property enable nbp exert suppressive potential remain limited show nbp novel linear ubiquitin reader negatively regulates nfb signalling unique dimerizationdependent ubiquitinbinding module named lubin dimeric nbp strategically position two nonselective ubiquitinbinding domain ensure preferential recognition linear ubiquitin proinflammatory condition nbp recruited nascent tnfr signalling complex regulates duration proinflammatory signalling lubindependent manner nbp deficiency accelerates tnfinduced cell death increasing complex ii assembly proapoptotic condition caspase mediates proteolytic processing nbp resulting rapid degradation nbp proteasome acceleration apoptosis summary finding demonstrate nbp dimerization creates novel type ubiquitin reader selectively recognises linear ubiquitin enables timely coordinated regulation tnfrmediated inflammation cell death

Here, we identify 7 families presenting a new cardiac entity associated with a heterozygous deletion of 2 CTCF binding sites on 4q25, inducing TAD fusion and chromatin conformation remodeling. The CTCF binding sites are located in a gene desert at 1 Mb from the Paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 gene (PITX2). By introducing the ortholog of the human deletion in the mouse genome, we recapitulate the patient phenotype and characterize an opposite dysregulation of PITX2 expression in the sinoatrial node (ectopic activation) and ventricle (reduction), respectively. Chromatin conformation assay performed in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes harboring the minimal deletion identified in family#1 reveals a conformation remodeling and fusion of TADs.

56,A novel variant in NSUN2 causes intellectual disability in a Chinese family.,"NSUN2-intellectual disability syndrome, also known as intellectual disability type 5 (MRT5), is an autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by intellectual disability (ID), postnatal growth retardation, dysmorphic facies, microcephaly, short stature, developmental delay, language impairment and other congenital abnormalities. The disease is caused by mutations in the NSUN2 gene, which encodes a tRNA cytosine methyltransferase that has an important role in spindle assembly during mitosis and chromosome segregation. In this study, we recruited a family that had two individuals with ID. Whole exome sequencing was performed to identify a homozygous frameshift variant (c.1171_1175delACCAT(p.Thr391fs*18*)) in NSUN2 (NM_017755.5) in the proband. The varint was confirmed as segregating in his affected brother and his parents by Sanger sequencing. The individuals that we described showed a similar dysmorphology profile to that associated with MRT5. To analyze the correlations between genotypes of NSUN2 and phenotypes of individuals with ID, we examined 17 variants and the associated phenotypes from 32 ID individuals in current and previous studies. We concluded that mutations in NSUN2 cause a wide range of phenotypic defects. Although some clinical manifestations were highly variable, the core phenotypes associated with NSUN2 mutations were dysmorphic facies, microcephaly, short stature, ID, growth restriction, language impairment, hypotonia and delayed puberty.

Moreover, the initial and radiation-induced cell cycle profiles can significantly influence radiotherapy responses as radiation sensitivity fluctuates across different cell cycle stages.

68,Impact of the inaccessible genome on genotype imputation and genome-wide association studies.,"Genotype imputation is widely used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, both the genotyping chips and imputation reference panels are dependent on next-generation sequencing (NGS). Due to the nature of NGS, some regions of the genome are inaccessible to sequencing. To date, there has been no complete evaluation of these regions and their impact on the identification of associations in GWAS remains unclear. In this study, we systematically assess the extent to which variants in inaccessible regions are underrepresented on genotyping chips and imputation reference panels, in GWAS results and in variant databases. We also determine the proportion of genes located in inaccessible regions and compare the results across variant masks defined by the 1000 Genomes Project and the TOPMed program. Overall, fewer variants were observed in inaccessible regions in all categories analyzed. Depending on the mask used and normalized for region size, only 4%-17% of the genotyped variants are located in inaccessible regions and 52 to 581 genes were almost completely inaccessible. From the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study, we present a case study of an association located in an inaccessible region that is driven by genotyped variants and cannot be reproduced by imputation in GRCh37. We conclude that genotyping, NGS, genotype imputation and downstream analyses such as GWAS and fine mapping are systematically biased in inaccessible regions, due to missed variants and spurious associations.

70,"Non-canonical functions of enhancers: regulation of RNA polymerase III transcription, DNA replication, and V(D)J recombination.","Enhancers are the key regulators of other DNA-based processes by virtue of their unique ability to generate nucleosome-depleted regions in a highly regulated manner. Enhancers regulate cell-type-specific transcription of tRNA genes by RNA polymerase III (Pol III). They are also responsible for the binding of the origin replication complex (ORC) to DNA replication origins, thereby regulating origin utilization, replication timing, and replication-dependent chromosome breaks. Additionally, enhancers regulate V(D)J recombination by increasing access of the recombination-activating gene (RAG) recombinase to target sites and by generating non-coding enhancer RNAs and localized regions of trimethylated histone H3-K4 recognized by the RAG2 PHD domain.

71,Expression of an endo-rhamnogalacturonase from Aspergillus aculeatus enhances release of Arabidopsis transparent mucilage.,"Mucilage is a gelatinous and sticky hydrophilic polysaccharide released from epidermal cells of seed coat after the hydration of mature seeds and is composed primarily of unbranched rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I). In this study, we produced a recombinant endo-RG-I hydrolase from Aspergillus aculeatus (AaRhgA) in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and examined its substrate preference for pyridylaminated (PA) RG-I with the various degrees of polymerization (DP). Recombinant AaRhgA requires PA-RG-I with a DP of 10 or higher for its hydrolase activity. We heterologously expressed the AarhgA gene under the strong constitutive promoter, cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, in Arabidopsis thaliana. In a series of biochemical analyses of each mucilage fraction released from the water-imbibed seeds of the transgenic plants, we found the enhanced deposition of the transparent mucilage layer that existed in the peripheral regions of the adherent mucilage and was not stained with ruthenium red.

72,Spatial enrichment and genomic analyses reveal the link of NOMO1 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe motor neuron disease with uncertain genetic predisposition in most sporadic cases. Spatial architecture of cell types and gene expression is the basis of cell-cell interactions, biological function and disease pathology, but is not well investigated in human motor cortex, a key ALS relevant brain region. Recent studies indicated single nucleus transcriptomic features of motor neuron vulnerability in ALS motor cortex. However, it remains largely unclear what is the brain regional vulnerability of ALS-associated genes, and what is the genetic link between region-specific genes and ALS risk. Here, we developed an entropy-weighted differential gene expression matrix-based tool (SpatialE) to identify the spatial enrichment of gene sets in spatial transcriptomics (ST). We benchmarked SpatialE against another enrichment tool (Multimodal Intersection Analysis, MIA) using ST data from both human and mouse brain tissues. To investigate regional vulnerability, we analyzed three human motor cortex and two dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues for spatial enrichment of ALS-associated genes. We also used Cell2location to estimate the abundance of cell types in ALS-related cortex layers. To dissect the link of regionally expressed genes and ALS risk, we performed burden analyses of rare loss-of-function (LOF) variants detected by whole-genome sequencing in ALS patients and controls, and then analyzed differential gene expression in the TargetALS RNA-seq dataset. SpatialE showed more accurate and specific spatial enrichment of regional cell type markers than MIA in both mouse brain and human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Spatial transcriptomic analyses of human motor cortex showed heterogenous cell types and spatial gene expression profiles. We found that 260 manually curated ALS-associated genes are significantly enriched in layer 5 (L5) motor cortex, with abundant expression of upper motor neurons and L5 excitatory neurons. Burden analyses of rare LOF variants in L5-associated genes nominated NOMO1 as a novel ALS-associated gene in a combined sample set of 6,814 ALS patients and 3,324 controls (P = 0.029). Gene expression analyses in central nervous system tissues revealed down-regulation of NOMO1 in ALS, which is consistent with a LOF disease mechanism. In conclusion, our integrated ST and genomic analyses identified regional brain vulnerability in ALS and the association of a L5 gene (NOMO1) with ALS risk.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643019/,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis al severe motor neuron disease uncertain genetic predisposition sporadic case spatial architecture cell type gene expression basis cellcell interaction biological function disease pathology well investigated human motor cortex key al relevant brain region recent study indicated single nucleus transcriptomic feature motor neuron vulnerability al motor cortex however remains largely unclear brain regional vulnerability alsassociated gene genetic link regionspecific gene al risk developed entropyweighted differential gene expression matrixbased tool spatiale identify spatial enrichment gene set spatial transcriptomics st benchmarked spatiale another enrichment tool multimodal intersection analysis mia using st data human mouse brain tissue investigate regional vulnerability analyzed three human motor cortex two dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue spatial enrichment alsassociated gene also used celllocation estimate abundance cell type alsrelated cortex layer dissect link regionally expressed gene al risk performed burden analysis rare lossoffunction lof variant detected wholegenome sequencing al patient control analyzed differential gene expression targetals rnaseq dataset spatiale showed accurate specific spatial enrichment regional cell type marker mia mouse brain human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex spatial transcriptomic analysis human motor cortex showed heterogenous cell type spatial gene expression profile found manually curated alsassociated gene significantly enriched layer l motor cortex abundant expression upper motor neuron l excitatory neuron burden analysis rare lof variant lassociated gene nominated nomo novel alsassociated gene combined sample set al patient control p gene expression analysis central nervous system tissue revealed downregulation nomo al consistent lof disease mechanism conclusion integrated st genomic analysis identified regional brain vulnerability al association l gene nomo al risk

76,Binding evolution of the Dengue Virus Envelope against DC-SIGN: A combined approach of phylogenetics and molecular dynamics analyses over 30 years of Dengue Virus in Brazil.,"The Red Queen Hypothesis (RQH), derived from Lewis Carroll's ""Through the Looking-Glass"", postulates that organisms must continually adapt in response to each other to maintain relative fitness. Within the context of host-pathogen interactions, the RQH implies an evolutionary arms race, wherein viruses evolve to exploit hosts and hosts evolve to resist viral invasion. This study delves into the dynamics of the RQH in the context of virus-cell interactions, specifically focusing on virus receptors and cell receptors. We observed multiple virus-host systems and noted patterns of co-evolution. As viruses evolved receptor-binding proteins to effectively engage with cell receptors, cells countered by altering their receptor genes. This ongoing mutual adaptation cycle has influenced the molecular intricacies of receptor-ligand interactions. Our data supports the RQH as a driving force behind the diversification and specialization of both viral and host cell receptors. Understanding this co-evolutionary dance offers insights into the unpredictability of emerging viral diseases and potential therapeutic interventions. Future research is crucial to dissect the nuanced molecular changes and the broader ecological consequences of this ever-evolving battle. Here, we combine phylogenetic inferences, structural modeling, and molecular dynamics analyses to describe the epidemiological characteristics of major Brazilian DENV strains that circulated from 1990 to 2022 from a combined perspective, thus providing us with a more detailed picture on the dynamics of such interactions over time.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642883/,red queen hypothesis rqh derived lewis carroll lookingglass postulate organism must continually adapt response maintain relative fitness within context hostpathogen interaction rqh implies evolutionary arm race wherein virus evolve exploit host host evolve resist viral invasion study delf dynamic rqh context viruscell interaction specifically focusing virus receptor cell receptor observed multiple virushost system noted pattern coevolution virus evolved receptorbinding protein effectively engage cell receptor cell countered altering receptor gene ongoing mutual adaptation cycle influenced molecular intricacy receptorligand interaction data support rqh driving force behind diversification specialization viral host cell receptor understanding coevolutionary dance offer insight unpredictability emerging viral disease potential therapeutic intervention future research crucial dissect nuanced molecular change broader ecological consequence everevolving battle combine phylogenetic inference structural modeling molecular dynamic analysis describe epidemiological characteristic major brazilian denv strain circulated combined perspective thus providing u detailed picture dynamic interaction time
77,The alternative enzymes-bearing tunicates lack multiple widely distributed genes coding for peripheral OXPHOS subunits.,"The respiratory chain alternative enzymes (AEs) NDX and AOX from the tunicate Ciona intestinalis (Ascidiacea) have been xenotopically expressed and characterized in human cells in culture and in the model organisms Drosophila melanogaster and mouse, with the purpose of developing bypass therapies to combat mitochondrial diseases in human patients with defective complexes I and III/IV, respectively. The fact that the genes coding for NDX and AOX have been lost from genomes of evolutionarily successful animal groups, such as vertebrates and insects, led us to investigate if the composition of the respiratory chain of Ciona and other tunicates differs significantly from that of humans and Drosophila, to accommodate the natural presence of AEs. We have failed to identify in tunicate genomes fifteen orthologous genes that code for subunits of the respiratory chain complexes; all of these putatively missing subunits are peripheral to complexes I, III and IV in mammals, and many are important for complex-complex interaction in supercomplexes (SCs), such as NDUFA11, UQCR11 and COX7A. Modeling of all respiratory chain subunit polypeptides of Ciona indicates significant structural divergence that is consistent with the lack of these fifteen clear orthologous subunits. We also provide evidence using Ciona AOX expressed in Drosophila that this AE cannot access the coenzyme Q pool reduced by complex I, but it is readily available to oxidize coenzyme Q molecules reduced by glycerophosphate oxidase, a mitochondrial inner membrane-bound dehydrogenase that is not involved in SCs. Altogether, our results suggest that Ciona AEs might have evolved in a mitochondrial inner membrane environment much different from that of mammals and insects, possibly without SCs; this correlates with the preferential functional interaction between these AEs and non-SC dehydrogenases in heterologous mammalian and insect systems. We discuss the implications of these findings for the applicability of Ciona AEs in human bypass therapies and for our understanding of the evolution of animal respiratory chain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642871/,respiratory chain alternative enzyme aes ndx aox tunicate ciona intestinalis ascidiacea xenotopically expressed characterized human cell culture model organism drosophila melanogaster mouse purpose developing bypass therapy combat mitochondrial disease human patient defective complex iiiiv respectively fact gene coding ndx aox lost genome evolutionarily successful animal group vertebrate insect led u investigate composition respiratory chain ciona tunicate differs significantly human drosophila accommodate natural presence aes failed identify tunicate genome fifteen orthologous gene code subunit respiratory chain complex putatively missing subunit peripheral complex iii iv mammal many important complexcomplex interaction supercomplexes sc ndufa uqcr coxa modeling respiratory chain subunit polypeptide ciona indicates significant structural divergence consistent lack fifteen clear orthologous subunit also provide evidence using ciona aox expressed drosophila ae access coenzyme q pool reduced complex readily available oxidize coenzyme q molecule reduced glycerophosphate oxidase mitochondrial inner membranebound dehydrogenase involved sc altogether result suggest ciona aes might evolved mitochondrial inner membrane environment much different mammal insect possibly without sc correlate preferential functional interaction aes nonsc dehydrogenases heterologous mammalian insect system discus implication finding applicability ciona aes human bypass therapy understanding evolution animal respiratory chain

82,"Intermittent fasting, exercise and dietary modification induce unique transcriptomic signatures of multiple tissues governing metabolic homeostasis during weight loss and rebound weight gain.","Obesity and its related metabolic diseases bring great challenges to public health. In-depth understanding on the efficacy of weight-loss interventions is critical for long-term weight control. Our study demonstrated the comparable efficacy of exercise (EX), intermittent fasting (IF), or the change of daily diet from an unhealthy to a normal chow (DR) for weight reduction, but largely divergently affected metabolic status and transcriptome of subcutaneous fat, scapular brown fat, skeletal muscles and liver in high-fat-high-fructose diet (HFHF) induced obese mice. EX and IF reduced systematic inflammation, improved glucose and lipid metabolism in liver and muscle, and amino acid metabolism and thermogenesis in adipose tissues. EX exhibited broad regulatory effects on TCA cycle, carbon metabolism, thermogenesis, propanoate-, fatty acid and amino acid metabolism across multiple tissues. IF prominently affected genes involved in mitophagy and autophagy in adipose tissues and core genes involved in butanoate metabolism in liver. DR however failed to improve metabolic homeostasis and biological dysfunctions in obese mice. Notably, by exploring potential inter-organ communication, we identified an obesity-resistant-like gene profile that were strongly correlated with HFHF induced metabolic derangements and could predict the degree of weight regain induced by the follow-up HFHF diet. Among them, 12 genes (e.g., Gdf15, Tfrc, Cdv3, Map2k4 and Nqo1) were causally associated with human metabolic traits, i.e., BMI, body fat mass, HbA1C, fasting glucose and cholesterol.

84,Advances in nuclear proteostasis of metazoans.,"The proteostasis network and associated protein quality control (PQC) mechanisms ensure proteome functionality and are essential for cell survival. A distinctive feature of eukaryotic cells is their high degree of compartmentalization, requiring specific and adapted proteostasis networks for each compartment. The nucleus, essential for maintaining the integrity of genetic information and gene transcription, is one such compartment. While PQC mechanisms have been investigated for decades in the cytoplasm and the endoplasmic reticulum, our knowledge of nuclear PQC pathways is only emerging. Recent developments in the field have underscored the importance of spatially managing aberrant proteins within the nucleus. Upon proteotoxic stress, misfolded proteins and PQC effectors accumulate in various nuclear membrane-less organelles. Beyond bringing together effectors and substrates, the biophysical properties of these organelles allow novel PQC functions.

In this study, 3-, 12- and 18- month-old APP/PS1 mice and WT littermates underwent memory tests, then synapse-related gene expression, class 1 histone deacetylases (HDACs) abundance, and H3K9ac levels at target gene promoters, were evaluated in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Our results showed recognition and long-term spatial memory impaired in 18-month-old WT mice and recognition, short-term working, and long-term spatial reference memory deficits in 12-and 18- month-old APP/PS1 mice. The memory impairments are associated with synapse-related gene nr2a, glur1, glur2, psd95 expression, HDAC abundance, and H3K9ac regulation. More specifically, HDAC 2 modulated synapse-related gene expression through H3K9ac at the gene promoters during aging and AD progression in the hippocampus. Conversely, HDAC 3 modulated synapse-related gene expression through H3K9ac at the gene promoters during AD progression in the PFC.

88,Architecture of β-Lactoglobulin Coating Modulates Bioinspired Alginate Dialdehyde-Gelatine/Polydopamine Scaffolds for Subchondral Bone Regeneration.,"In this study, we developed polydopamine (PDA)-functionalized alginate dialdehyde-gelatine (ADA-GEL) scaffolds for subchondral bone regeneration. These polymeric scaffolds were then coated with β-Lactoglobulin (β-LG) at concentrations of 1 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml. Morphological analysis indicated a homogeneous coating of the β-LG layer on the surface of network-like scaffolds. The β-LG-coated scaffolds exhibited improved swelling capacity as a function of the β-LG concentration. Compared to ADA-GEL/PDA scaffolds, the β-LG-coated scaffolds demonstrated delayed degradation and enhanced biomineralization. Here, a lower concentration of β-LG showed long-lasting stability and superior biomimetic hydroxyapatite mineralization. According to the theoretical findings, the single-state, representing the low concentration of β-LG, exhibited homogeneous distribution on the surface of the PDA, while the dimer-state (high concentration) displayed a high likelihood of uncontrolled interactions. β-LG-coated ADA-GEL/PDA scaffolds with a lower concentration of β-LG provided a biocompatible substrate that supported adhesion, proliferation, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) secretion of sheep bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, as well as increased expression of osteopontin (SPP1) and collagen type 1 (COL1A1) in human osteoblasts. These findings indicate the potential of protein-coated scaffolds for subchondral bone tissue regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study addresses a crucial aspect of osteochondral defect repair, emphasizing the pivotal role of subchondral bone regeneration. The development of polydopamine-functionalized alginate dialdehyde-gelatine (ADA-GEL) scaffolds, coated with β-Lactoglobulin (β-LG), represents a novel approach to potentially enhance subchondral bone repair. β-LG, a milk protein rich in essential amino acids and bioactive peptides, is investigated for its potential to promote subchondral bone regeneration. This research explores computationally and experimentally the influence of protein concentration on the ordered or irregular deposition, unravelling the interplay between coating structure, scaffold properties, and in-vitro performance.

89,CXXC5 drove inflammation and ovarian cancer proliferation via transcriptional activation of ZNF143 and EGR1.,"CXXC5, a zinc-finger protein, is known for its role in epigenetic regulation via binding to unmethylated CpG islands in gene promoters. As a transcription factor and epigenetic regulator, CXXC5 modulates various signaling processes and acts as a key coordinator. Altered expression or activity of CXXC5 has been linked to various pathological conditions, including tumorigenesis. Despite its known role in cancer, CXXC5's function and mechanism in ovarian cancer are unclear. We analyzed multiple public databases and found that CXXC5 is highly expressed in ovarian cancer, with high expression correlating with poor patient prognosis. We show that CXXC5 expression is regulated by oxygen concentration and is a direct target of HIF1A. CXXC5 is critical for maintaining the proliferative potential of ovarian cancer cells, with knockdown decreasing and overexpression increasing cell proliferation. Loss of CXXC5 led to inactivation of multiple inflammatory signaling pathways, while overexpression activated these pathways. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we confirmed ZNF143 and EGR1 as downstream transcription factors of CXXC5, mediating its proliferative potential in ovarian cancer.

94,Nitrogen fertilization modulates rice phyllosphere functional genes and pathogens through fungal communities.,"The phyllosphere is a vital yet often neglected habitat hosting diverse microorganisms with various functions. However, studies regarding how the composition and functions of the phyllosphere microbiome respond to agricultural practices, like nitrogen fertilization, are limited. This study investigated the effects of long-term nitrogen fertilization with different levels (CK, N90, N210, N330) on the functional genes and pathogens of the rice phyllosphere microbiome. Results showed that the relative abundance of many microbial functional genes in the rice phyllosphere was significantly affected by nitrogen fertilization, especially those involved in C fixation and denitrification genes. Different nitrogen fertilization levels have greater effects on fungal communities than bacteria communities in the rice phyllosphere, and network analysis and structural equation models further elucidate that fungal communities not only changed bacterial-fungal inter-kingdom interactions in the phyllosphere but also contributed to the variation of biogeochemical cycle potential. Besides, the moderate nitrogen fertilization level (N210) was associated with an enrichment of beneficial microbes in the phyllosphere, while also resulting in the lowest abundance of pathogenic fungi (1.14 %). In contrast, the highest abundance of pathogenic fungi (1.64 %) was observed in the highest nitrogen fertilization level (N330). This enrichment of pathogen due to high nitrogen level was also regulated by the fungal communities, as revealed through SEM analysis. Together, we demonstrated that the phyllosphere fungal communities were more sensitive to the nitrogen fertilization levels and played a crucial role in influencing phyllosphere functional profiles including element cycling potential and pathogen abundance. This study expands our knowledge regarding the role of phyllosphere fungal communities in modulating the element cycling and plant health in sustainable agriculture.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642761/,phyllosphere vital yet often neglected habitat hosting diverse microorganism various function however study regarding composition function phyllosphere microbiome respond agricultural practice like nitrogen fertilization limited study investigated effect longterm nitrogen fertilization different level ck n n n functional gene pathogen rice phyllosphere microbiome result showed relative abundance many microbial functional gene rice phyllosphere significantly affected nitrogen fertilization especially involved c fixation denitrification gene different nitrogen fertilization level greater effect fungal community bacteria community rice phyllosphere network analysis structural equation model elucidate fungal community changed bacterialfungal interkingdom interaction phyllosphere also contributed variation biogeochemical cycle potential besides moderate nitrogen fertilization level n associated enrichment beneficial microbe phyllosphere also resulting lowest abundance pathogenic fungi contrast highest abundance pathogenic fungi observed highest nitrogen fertilization level n enrichment pathogen due high nitrogen level also regulated fungal community revealed sem analysis together demonstrated phyllosphere fungal community sensitive nitrogen fertilization level played crucial role influencing phyllosphere functional profile including element cycling potential pathogen abundance study expands knowledge regarding role phyllosphere fungal community modulating element cycling plant health sustainable agriculture
95,Transgenerational acclimation to acidified seawater and gene expression patterns in a sea urchin.,"Transgenerational responses of susceptible calcifying organisms to progressive ocean acidification are an important issue in reducing uncertainty of future predictions. In this study, a two-generation rearing experiment was conducted using mature Mesocentrotus nudus, a major edible sea urchin that occurs along the coasts of northern Japan. Morphological observations and comprehensive gene expression analysis (RNA-seq) of resulting larvae were performed to examine transgenerational acclimation to acidified seawater. Two generations of rearing experiments showed that larvae derived from parents acclimated to acidified seawater tended to have higher survival and show less reduction in body size when exposed to acidified seawater of the same pH, suggesting that a positive carry-over effect occurred. RNA-seq analysis showed that gene expression patterns of larvae originated from both acclimated and non-acclimated parents to acidified seawater tended to be different than control condition, and the gene expression pattern of larvae originated from acclimated parents was substantially different than that of larvae of non-acclimated and control parents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642751/,transgenerational response susceptible calcifying organism progressive ocean acidification important issue reducing uncertainty future prediction study twogeneration rearing experiment conducted using mature mesocentrotus nudus major edible sea urchin occurs along coast northern japan morphological observation comprehensive gene expression analysis rnaseq resulting larva performed examine transgenerational acclimation acidified seawater two generation rearing experiment showed larva derived parent acclimated acidified seawater tended higher survival show le reduction body size exposed acidified seawater ph suggesting positive carryover effect occurred rnaseq analysis showed gene expression pattern larva originated acclimated nonacclimated parent acidified seawater tended different control condition gene expression pattern larva originated acclimated parent substantially different larva nonacclimated control parent
96,Coping with salinity extremes: Gill transcriptome profiling in the black-chinned tilapia (Sarotherodon melanotheron).,"Steeper and sometimes extreme salinity gradients increasingly affect aquatic organisms because of climate change. Hypersalinity habitats demand powerful physiological adaptive strategies. Few teleost species have the capacity to spend their whole life cycle in salinities way over seawater levels. Focusing on the multifunctional gill, we unraveled the tilapia S. melanotheron key strategies to cope with different environmental conditions, ranging from freshwater up to hypersaline habitats. De novo transcriptome assembly based on RNAseq allowed for the analysis of 40,967 annotated transcripts among samples collected in three wild populations at 0, 40 and 80 ‰. A trend analysis of the expression patterns revealed responses across the salinity gradient with different gene pathways involved. Genes linked to ion transport, pH regulation and cell surface receptor signaling were mainly upregulated in the high salinity habitat. We identified tight junction proteins that were critical in high salinity habitats and that were different from the well-known tightening junctional proteins identified and expressed in fresh water. Expression profiles also suggest a change in the vascular tone that could be linked to an osmorespiratory compromise not only in fresh water, but also in high salinity environments. A striking downregulation of genes linked to the immune system and to the heat shock response was observed suggesting an energetic trade-off between immunity and acclimation/adaptation in the hypersaline habitat. The high expression of transcripts coding for immune and heat shock response in the freshwater habitat suggests the establishment of powerful mechanisms to protect gills from environmental threats and to maintain protein integrity. Non-directional expression trends were also detected with an upregulation of genes only in the hypersaline habitat (80 ‰) or only in the marine habitat (40 ‰). Unravel physiological strategies in S. melanotheron populations will help to better understand the molecular basis of fish euryhalinity in salinity-contrasted environments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642748/,steeper sometimes extreme salinity gradient increasingly affect aquatic organism climate change hypersalinity habitat demand powerful physiological adaptive strategy teleost specie capacity spend whole life cycle salinity way seawater level focusing multifunctional gill unraveled tilapia melanotheron key strategy cope different environmental condition ranging freshwater hypersaline habitat de novo transcriptome assembly based rnaseq allowed analysis annotated transcript among sample collected three wild population trend analysis expression pattern revealed response across salinity gradient different gene pathway involved gene linked ion transport ph regulation cell surface receptor signaling mainly upregulated high salinity habitat identified tight junction protein critical high salinity habitat different wellknown tightening junctional protein identified expressed fresh water expression profile also suggest change vascular tone could linked osmorespiratory compromise fresh water also high salinity environment striking downregulation gene linked immune system heat shock response observed suggesting energetic tradeoff immunity acclimationadaptation hypersaline habitat high expression transcript coding immune heat shock response freshwater habitat suggests establishment powerful mechanism protect gill environmental threat maintain protein integrity nondirectional expression trend also detected upregulation gene hypersaline habitat marine habitat unravel physiological strategy melanotheron population help better understand molecular basis fish euryhalinity salinitycontrasted environment
97,Differential impact of intermittent versus continuous treatment with clozapine on fatty acid metabolism in the brain of an MK-801-induced mouse model of schizophrenia.,"Continuous antipsychotic treatment is often recommended to prevent relapse in schizophrenia. However, the efficacy of antipsychotic treatment appears to diminish in patients with relapsed schizophrenia and the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Moreover, though the findings are inconclusive, several recent studies suggest that intermittent versus continuous treatment may not significantly differ in recurrence risk and therapeutic efficacy but potentially reduce the drug dose and side effects. Notably, disturbances in fatty acid (FA) metabolism are linked to the onset/relapse of schizophrenia, and patients with multi-episode schizophrenia have been reported to have reduced FA biosynthesis. We thus utilized an MK-801-induced animal model of schizophrenia to evaluate whether two treatment strategies of clozapine would affect drug response and FA metabolism differently in the brain. Schizophrenia-related behaviors were assessed through open field test (OFT) and prepulse inhibition (PPI) test, and FA profiles of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additionally, we measured gene expression levels of enzymes involved in FA synthesis. Both intermittent and continuous clozapine treatment reversed hypermotion and deficits in PPI in mice. Continuous treatment decreased total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and FAs in the PFC, whereas the intermittent administration increased n-6 PUFAs, SFAs and FAs compared to continuous administration. Meanwhile, continuous treatment reduced the expression of Fads1 and Elovl2, while intermittent treatment significantly upregulated them. This study discloses the novel findings that there was no significant difference in clozapine efficacy between continuous and intermittent administration, but intermittent treatment showed certain protective effects on phospholipid metabolism in the PFC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642730/,continuous antipsychotic treatment often recommended prevent relapse schizophrenia however efficacy antipsychotic treatment appears diminish patient relapsed schizophrenia underlying mechanism still unknown moreover though finding inconclusive several recent study suggest intermittent versus continuous treatment may significantly differ recurrence risk therapeutic efficacy potentially reduce drug dose side effect notably disturbance fatty acid fa metabolism linked onsetrelapse schizophrenia patient multiepisode schizophrenia reported reduced fa biosynthesis thus utilized mkinduced animal model schizophrenia evaluate whether two treatment strategy clozapine would affect drug response fa metabolism differently brain schizophreniarelated behavior assessed open field test oft prepulse inhibition ppi test fa profile prefrontal cortex pfc hippocampus analyzed gas chromatographymass spectrometry additionally measured gene expression level enzyme involved fa synthesis intermittent continuous clozapine treatment reversed hypermotion deficit ppi mouse continuous treatment decreased total polyunsaturated fatty acid pufas saturated fatty acid sfas fa pfc whereas intermittent administration increased n pufas sfas fa compared continuous administration meanwhile continuous treatment reduced expression fad elovl intermittent treatment significantly upregulated study discloses novel finding significant difference clozapine efficacy continuous intermittent administration intermittent treatment showed certain protective effect phospholipid metabolism pfc
98,A review of DNA nanoparticles-encapsulated drug/gene/protein for advanced controlled drug release: Current status and future perspective over emerging therapy approaches.,"In the last ten years, the field of nanomedicine has experienced significant progress in creating novel drug delivery systems (DDSs). An effective strategy involves employing DNA nanoparticles (NPs) as carriers to encapsulate drugs, genes, or proteins, facilitating regulated drug release. This abstract examines the utilization of DNA NPs and their potential applications in strategies for controlled drug release. Researchers have utilized the distinctive characteristics of DNA molecules, including their ability to self-assemble and their compatibility with living organisms, to create NPs specifically for the purpose of delivering drugs. The DNA NPs possess numerous benefits compared to conventional drug carriers, such as exceptional stability, adjustable dimensions and structure, and convenient customization. Researchers have successfully achieved a highly efficient encapsulation of different therapeutic agents by carefully designing their structure and composition. This advancement enables precise and targeted delivery of drugs. The incorporation of drugs, genes, or proteins into DNA NPs provides notable advantages in terms of augmenting therapeutic effectiveness while reducing adverse effects. DNA NPs serve as a protective barrier for the enclosed payloads, preventing their degradation and extending their duration in the body. The protective effect is especially vital for delicate biologics, such as proteins or gene-based therapies that could otherwise be vulnerable to enzymatic degradation or quick elimination. Moreover, the surface of DNA NPs can be altered to facilitate specific targeting towards particular tissues or cells, thereby augmenting the accuracy of delivery. A significant benefit of DNA NPs is their capacity to regulate the kinetics of drug release. Through the manipulation of the DNA NPs structure, scientists can regulate the rate at which the enclosed cargo is released, enabling a prolonged and regulated dispensation of medication. This control is crucial for medications with limited therapeutic ranges or those necessitating uninterrupted administration to attain optimal therapeutic results. In addition, DNA NPs have the ability to react to external factors, including alterations in temperature, pH, or light, which can initiate the release of the payload at precise locations or moments. This feature enhances the precision of drug release control. The potential uses of DNA NPs in the controlled release of medicines are extensive. The NPs have the ability to transport various therapeutic substances, for example, drugs, peptides, NAs (NAs), and proteins. They exhibit potential for the therapeutic management of diverse ailments, including cancer, genetic disorders, and infectious diseases. In addition, DNA NPs can be employed for targeted drug delivery, traversing biological barriers, and surpassing the constraints of conventional drug administration methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642693/,last ten year field nanomedicine experienced significant progress creating novel drug delivery system dds effective strategy involves employing dna nanoparticles np carrier encapsulate drug gene protein facilitating regulated drug release abstract examines utilization dna np potential application strategy controlled drug release researcher utilized distinctive characteristic dna molecule including ability selfassemble compatibility living organism create np specifically purpose delivering drug dna np posse numerous benefit compared conventional drug carrier exceptional stability adjustable dimension structure convenient customization researcher successfully achieved highly efficient encapsulation different therapeutic agent carefully designing structure composition advancement enables precise targeted delivery drug incorporation drug gene protein dna np provides notable advantage term augmenting therapeutic effectiveness reducing adverse effect dna np serve protective barrier enclosed payload preventing degradation extending duration body protective effect especially vital delicate biologics protein genebased therapy could otherwise vulnerable enzymatic degradation quick elimination moreover surface dna np altered facilitate specific targeting towards particular tissue cell thereby augmenting accuracy delivery significant benefit dna np capacity regulate kinetics drug release manipulation dna np structure scientist regulate rate enclosed cargo released enabling prolonged regulated dispensation medication control crucial medication limited therapeutic range necessitating uninterrupted administration attain optimal therapeutic result addition dna np ability react external factor including alteration temperature ph light initiate release payload precise location moment feature enhances precision drug release control potential us dna np controlled release medicine extensive np ability transport various therapeutic substance example drug peptide na na protein exhibit potential therapeutic management diverse ailment including cancer genetic disorder infectious disease addition dna np employed targeted drug delivery traversing biological barrier surpassing constraint conventional drug administration method
99,Goat milk exosomal microRNAs alleviate LPS-induced intestinal inflammation in mice.,"Intestinal inflammation is a common digestive system disease. Milk-derived exosomes can participate in intercellular communication and transport a variety of bioactive components, and the microRNAs (miRNAs) they carry play important roles in a variety of biological processes in the body. At present, the preventive effect and mechanism of action of goat milk exosomes and their derived miRNAs on intestinal inflammation are still unclear. In this study, the protective effect of goat milk exosomes on LPS-induced intestinal inflammation was investigated using mouse intestinal inflammation model and IEC-6 cell inflammation model. Small RNA sequencing was used to analyze the miRNA expression profile of goat milk exosomes. In this study, C-Exo and M-Exo alleviated intestinal inflammation by reducing the LPS-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines, inhibiting the increase in the NLRP3 protein and the activation of the TLR4/NFκB signaling pathway. C-Exo has a more significant inhibitory effect on them, and better therapeutic efficacy than M-Exo. Notably, the target genes of miRNAs in C-Exo and M-Exo were significantly enriched in immune-related pathways. Furthermore, their derived miR-26a-5p and miR-30a-5p were found to ameliorate the IEC-6 inflammatory response. These findings suggest that miRNAs in goat milk exosomes have the potential to attenuate LPS-induced intestinal inflammation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642690/,intestinal inflammation common digestive system disease milkderived exosomes participate intercellular communication transport variety bioactive component micrornas mirnas carry play important role variety biological process body present preventive effect mechanism action goat milk exosomes derived mirnas intestinal inflammation still unclear study protective effect goat milk exosomes lpsinduced intestinal inflammation investigated using mouse intestinal inflammation model iec cell inflammation model small rna sequencing used analyze mirna expression profile goat milk exosomes study cexo mexo alleviated intestinal inflammation reducing lpsinduced release proinflammatory cytokine inhibiting increase nlrp protein activation tlrnfb signaling pathway cexo significant inhibitory effect better therapeutic efficacy mexo notably target gene mirnas cexo mexo significantly enriched immunerelated pathway furthermore derived mirap mirap found ameliorate iec inflammatory response finding suggest mirnas goat milk exosomes potential attenuate lpsinduced intestinal inflammation

The misuse of antibiotics exacerbates skin infections by generating multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this study, we developed chemo-photothermal therapy (chemo-PTT) based on near-infrared (NIR)-irradiated chitosan/gold nanorod (GNR) clusters as anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) agents. The nanocomposites exhibited an average size of 223 nm with a surface charge of 36 mV. These plasmonic nanocomposites demonstrated on-demand and rapid hyperthermal action under NIR. The combined effect of positive charge and PTT by NIR-irradiated nanocomposites resulted in a remarkable inhibition rate of 96 % against planktonic MRSA, indicating a synergistic activity compared to chitosan nanoparticles or GNR alone. The nanocomposites easily penetrated the biofilm matrix. The combination of chemical and photothermal treatments by NIR-stimulated clusters significantly damaged the biofilm structure, eradicating MRSA inside the biomass. NIR-irradiated chitosan/GNR clusters increased the skin temperature of mice by 13 °C. The plasmonic nanocomposites induced negligible skin irritation in vivo.

101,"Exosomes derived from vMIP-II-Lamp2b gene-modified M2 cells provide neuroprotection by targeting the injured spinal cord, inhibiting chemokine signals and modulating microglia/macrophage polarization in mice.","Inflammation is one of the key injury factors for spinal cord injury (SCI). Exosomes (Exos) derived from M2 macrophages have been shown to inhibit inflammation and be beneficial in SCI animal models. However, lacking targetability restricts their application prospects. Considering that chemokine receptors increase dramatically after SCI, viral macrophage inflammatory protein II (vMIP-II) is a broad-spectrum chemokine receptor binding peptide, and lysosomal associated membrane protein 2b (Lamp2b) is the key membrane component of Exos, we speculated that vMIP-II-Lamp2b gene-modified M2 macrophage-derived Exos (vMIP-II-Lamp2b-M2-Exo) not only have anti-inflammatory properties, but also can target the injured area by vMIP-II. In this study, using a murine contusive SCI model, we revealed that vMIP-II-Lamp2b-M2-Exo could target the chemokine receptors which highly expressed in the injured spinal cords, inhibit some key chemokine receptor signaling pathways (such as MAPK and Akt), further inhibit proinflammatory factors (such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, IL-18, TNF-α, and iNOS), and promote anti-inflammatory factors (such as IL-4 and Arg1) productions, and the transformation of microglia/macrophages from M1 into M2. Moreover, the improved histological and functional recoveries were also found. Collectively, our results suggest that vMIP-II-Lamp2b-M2-Exo may provide neuroprotection by targeting the injured spinal cord, inhibiting some chemokine signals, reducing proinflammatory factor production and modulating microglia/macrophage polarization.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642665/,inflammation one key injury factor spinal cord injury sci exosomes exos derived macrophage shown inhibit inflammation beneficial sci animal model however lacking targetability restricts application prospect considering chemokine receptor increase dramatically sci viral macrophage inflammatory protein ii vmipii broadspectrum chemokine receptor binding peptide lysosomal associated membrane protein b lampb key membrane component exos speculated vmipiilampb genemodified macrophagederived exos vmipiilampbmexo antiinflammatory property also target injured area vmipii study using murine contusive sci model revealed vmipiilampbmexo could target chemokine receptor highly expressed injured spinal cord inhibit key chemokine receptor signaling pathway mapk akt inhibit proinflammatory factor il il il il tnf inos promote antiinflammatory factor il arg production transformation microgliamacrophages moreover improved histological functional recovery also found collectively result suggest vmipiilampbmexo may provide neuroprotection targeting injured spinal cord inhibiting chemokine signal reducing proinflammatory factor production modulating microgliamacrophage polarization

103,Single-cell analysis identifies critical regulators of spermatogonial development and differentiation in cattle-yak bulls.,"Spermatogenesis is a continuous process in which functional sperm are produced through a series of mitotic and meiotic divisions and morphological changes in germ cells. The aberrant development and fate transitions of spermatogenic cells cause hybrid sterility in mammals. Cattle-yak, a hybrid animal between taurine cattle (Bos taurus) and yak (Bos grunniens), exhibits male-specific sterility due to spermatogenic failure. In the present study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to identify differences in testicular cell composition and the developmental trajectory of spermatogenic cells between yak and cattle-yak. The composition and molecular signatures of spermatogonial subtypes were dramatically different between these 2 animals, and the expression of genes associated with stem cell maintenance, cell differentiation and meiotic entry was altered in cattle-yak, indicating the impairment of undifferentiated spermatogonial fate decisions. Cell communication analysis revealed that signaling within different spermatogenic cell subpopulations was weakened, and progenitor spermatogonia were unable or delayed receiving and sending signals for transformation to the next stage in cattle-yak. Simultaneously, the communication between niche cells and germ cells was also abnormal. Collectively, we obtained the expression profiles of transcriptome signatures of different germ cells and testicular somatic cell populations at the single-cell level and identified critical regulators of spermatogonial differentiation and meiosis in yak and sterile cattle-yak.

104,Endometrial responsiveness to interferon-tau and its association with subsequent reproductive performance in dairy heifers.,"Our objectives were to evaluate the endometrial responsiveness of dairy heifers to an intrauterine infusion of recombinant bovine interferon-tau (rbIFN-τ) and to associate endometrial responses to rbIFN-τ with subsequent reproductive performance. In Experiments 1 and 2, cyclic heifers were enrolled in a 5-d CIDR Cosynch program for estrous synchronization, and blood sampling and ultrasonography examinations were performed on d 0, 4, 7, 11, and 14 of the estrous cycle. In Experiment 1, heifers were randomly assigned to receive an intrauterine infusion containing 2 µg of rbIFN-τ (rbIFN-τ = 19) or saline (CTRL = 19) into the uterine horn ipsilateral to the corpus luteum (CL) on d 14 of the estrous cycle. Six hours after the infusion, the infused uterine horn was flushed for sampling of the uterine luminal fluid (ULF) for analyses of composition, and the endometrium was biopsied for transcriptomics. In Experiment 2, 100 heifers received an intrauterine infusion of rbIFN-τ, and the same procedures for uterine sample collection described in Experiment 1 were performed. After the intrauterine test, heifers were enrolled in a breeding program and classified as highly fertile (HF; pregnant at first AI) or subfertile (SF; not pregnant at first AI). Statistical analyses were performed using linear regression models, which included the effects of treatment (Experiment 1: CTRL vs. rbIFN-τ) or fertility group (Experiment 2: HF vs. SF) and block of samples. Intrauterine infusion of rbIFN-τ increased the expression of classical interferon-stimulated genes in the endometrium (e.g., ISG15, MX1, OAS2, IRF9, and USP18), and an antiviral response was predicted to be the main downstream effect of the transcriptome changes. In addition, rbIFN-τ increased the abundance of cholesterol, glycerol, and the overall concentration of oxylipins in the ULF. Analysis of endometrial transcriptome between HF and SF heifers revealed important differences in the expression of proteins associated with cell signaling, metabolism, attachment, and migration, with a large representation of genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins. In general, differently expressed genes were expected to be downregulated by IFN-τ but seemed to fail to be downregulated in SF heifers, resulting in higher expression in SF compared with HF heifers. Subfertile heifers had lower concentrations of glycerol and an altered profile of oxylipins in the ULF, with lower abundance of oxylipins derived from arachidonic acid and dihomo-γ-linolenic acid, and greater abundance of oxylipins derived from linoleic acid. Measurements of ovarian function did not differ between groups and, therefore, did not influence the observed results in uterine biology. In conclusion, the endometrial responsiveness to IFN-τ is variable among individuals and associated with subsequent fertility of heifers, indicating that communication between conceptus and endometrium is critical for the uterine receptivity and survival of pregnancy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642656/,objective evaluate endometrial responsiveness dairy heifer intrauterine infusion recombinant bovine interferontau rbifn associate endometrial response rbifn subsequent reproductive performance experiment cyclic heifer enrolled cidr cosynch program estrous synchronization blood sampling ultrasonography examination performed estrous cycle experiment heifer randomly assigned receive intrauterine infusion containing g rbifn rbifn saline ctrl uterine horn ipsilateral corpus luteum cl estrous cycle six hour infusion infused uterine horn flushed sampling uterine luminal fluid ulf analysis composition endometrium biopsied transcriptomics experiment heifer received intrauterine infusion rbifn procedure uterine sample collection described experiment performed intrauterine test heifer enrolled breeding program classified highly fertile hf pregnant first ai subfertile sf pregnant first ai statistical analysis performed using linear regression model included effect treatment experiment ctrl v rbifn fertility group experiment hf v sf block sample intrauterine infusion rbifn increased expression classical interferonstimulated gene endometrium eg isg mx oas irf usp antiviral response predicted main downstream effect transcriptome change addition rbifn increased abundance cholesterol glycerol overall concentration oxylipins ulf analysis endometrial transcriptome hf sf heifer revealed important difference expression protein associated cell signaling metabolism attachment migration large representation gene encoding extracellular matrix protein general differently expressed gene expected downregulated ifn seemed fail downregulated sf heifer resulting higher expression sf compared hf heifer subfertile heifer lower concentration glycerol altered profile oxylipins ulf lower abundance oxylipins derived arachidonic acid dihomolinolenic acid greater abundance oxylipins derived linoleic acid measurement ovarian function differ group therefore influence observed result uterine biology conclusion endometrial responsiveness ifn variable among individual associated subsequent fertility heifer indicating communication conceptus endometrium critical uterine receptivity survival pregnancy
105,HH5 Double-Carrier Embryos Fail to Progress through Early Conceptus Elongation.,"Massive genotyping in cattle has uncovered several deleterious haplotypes that cause pre-term mortality. Holstein Haplotype 5 (HH5) is a deleterious haplotype present in the Holstein Friesian population that involves the ablation of the Transcription Factor B1 mitochondrial (TFB1M) gene. The developmental stage at which HH5 double-carrier (DC, homozygous) embryos or fetuses die remains unknown and this is a relevant information to estimate the economic losses associated to the inadvertent cross between carriers. To determine if HH5 DC survive to maternal recognition of pregnancy, embryonic day (E)14 embryos were flushed from superovulated carrier cows inseminated with a carrier bull. DC E14 conceptuses were recovered at Mendelian rates but they failed to achieve early elongation, as evidenced by a drastic (>26-fold) reduction in the proliferation of extraembryonic membranes compared with carrier or non-carrier embryos. To assess development at earlier stages, TFB1M knockout (KO) embryos -functionally equivalent to DC embryos- were generated by CRISPR technology and cultured to the blastocyst stage -Day (D)8- and to the early embryonic disc stage -D12-. No significant effect of TFB1M ablation was observed on the differentiation and proliferation of embryonic lineages and relative mtDNA content up to D12.

This study aims to select a high IAA-producing Streptomyces-like strain isolated from Lake Oubeira sediments (El Kala, Algeria) for further investigations (i.e., 16S rRNA gene barcoding and process optimization). Subsequently, artificial intelligence-based approaches were employed to maximize IAA bioproduction on spent coffee grounds as high-value-added feedstock. The specificity was the novel application of the Limited-Memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno Box (L-BFGS-B) optimization algorithm. The new strain AW08 was a significant producer of IAA (26.116 ± 0.61 μg/mL) and was identified as Streptomyces rutgersensis by 16S rRNA gene barcoding and phylogenetic inquiry. The empirical data involved the inoculation of AW08 in various cultural conditions according to a four-factor Box Behnken Design matrix (BBD) of Response surface methodology (RSM). The input parameters and regression equation extracted from the RSM-BBD were the basis for implementing and training the L-BFGS-B algorithm. Upon training the model, the optimal conditions suggested by the BBD and L-BFGS-B algorithm were, respectively, L-Trp (X1) = 0.58 %; 0.57 %; T° (X2) = 26.37 °C; 28.19 °C; pH (X3) = 7.75; 8.59; and carbon source (X4) = 30 %; 33.29 %, with the predicted response IAA (Y) =152.8; 169.18 μg/mL). Our findings emphasize the potential of the multifunctional S. rutgersensis AW08, isolated and reported for the first time in Algeria, as a robust producer of IAA. Validation investigations using the bioprocess parameters provided by the L-BFGS-B and the BBD-RSM models demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-driven optimization in maximizing IAA output by 5.43-fold and 4.2-fold, respectively. This study constitutes the first paper reporting a novel interdisciplinary approach and providing insights into biotechnological advancements.

107,The nucleolus: Coordinating stress response and genomic stability.,"The perception that the nucleoli are merely the organelles where ribosome biogenesis occurs is challenged. Only around 30 % of nucleolar proteins are solely involved in producing ribosomes. Instead, the nucleolus plays a critical role in controlling protein trafficking during stress and, according to its dynamic nature, undergoes continuous protein exchange with nucleoplasm under various cellular stressors. Hence, the concept of nucleolar stress has evolved as cellular insults that disrupt the structure and function of the nucleolus. Considering the emerging role of this organelle in DNA repair and the fact that rDNAs are the most fragile genomic loci, therapies targeting the nucleoli are increasingly being developed. Besides, drugs that target ribosome synthesis and induce nucleolar stress can be used in cancer therapy. In contrast, agents that regulate nucleolar activity may be a potential treatment for neurodegeneration caused by abnormal protein accumulation in the nucleolus.

110,Polymorphisms in the cysteine dioxygenase gene and their association with taurine content in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas.,"The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is rich in taurine, which is crucial for its adaptation to the fluctuating intertidal environment and presents significant potential in improving taurine nutrition and boosting immunity in humans. Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) is a key enzyme involved in the initial step of taurine biosynthesis and plays a crucial role in regulating taurine content in the body. In the present study, polymorphisms of CDO gene in C. gigas (CgCDO) and their association with taurine content were evaluated in 198 individuals. A total of 24 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci were identified in the exonic region of the CgCDO gene by direct sequencing. Among these SNPs, c.279G > A and c.287C > A were found to be significantly associated with taurine content, with the GG and AA genotype at the two loci exhibiting enhanced taurine accumulation (p < 0.05). Haplotype analysis revealed that the 279GG/287AA haplotype had the highest taurine content of 29.24 mg/g, while the 279AA/287CC haplotype showed the lowest taurine content of 21.19 mg/g.

111,Network model of skeletal muscle cell signalling predicts differential responses to endurance and resistance exercise training.,"Exercise-induced muscle adaptations vary based on exercise modality and intensity. We constructed a signalling network model from 87 published studies of human or rodent skeletal muscle cell responses to endurance or resistance exercise in vivo or simulated exercise in vitro. The network comprises 259 signalling interactions between 120 nodes, representing eight membrane receptors and eight canonical signalling pathways regulating 14 transcriptional regulators, 28 target genes and 12 exercise-induced phenotypes. Using this network, we formulated a logic-based ordinary differential equation model predicting time-dependent molecular and phenotypic alterations following acute endurance and resistance exercises. Compared with nine independent studies, the model accurately predicted 18/21 (85%) acute responses to resistance exercise and 12/16 (75%) acute responses to endurance exercise. Detailed sensitivity analysis of differential phenotypic responses to resistance and endurance training showed that, in the model, exercise regulates cell growth and protein synthesis primarily by signalling via mechanistic target of rapamycin, which is activated by Akt and inhibited in endurance exercise by AMP-activated protein kinase. Endurance exercise preferentially activates inflammation via reactive oxygen species and nuclear factor κB signalling. Furthermore, the expected preferential activation of mitochondrial biogenesis by endurance exercise was counterbalanced in the model by protein kinase C in response to resistance training. This model provides a new tool for investigating cross-talk between skeletal muscle signalling pathways activated by endurance and resistance exercise, and the mechanisms of interactions such as the interference effects of endurance training on resistance exercise outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643471/,exerciseinduced muscle adaptation vary based exercise modality intensity constructed signalling network model published study human rodent skeletal muscle cell response endurance resistance exercise vivo simulated exercise vitro network comprises signalling interaction node representing eight membrane receptor eight canonical signalling pathway regulating transcriptional regulator target gene exerciseinduced phenotype using network formulated logicbased ordinary differential equation model predicting timedependent molecular phenotypic alteration following acute endurance resistance exercise compared nine independent study model accurately predicted acute response resistance exercise acute response endurance exercise detailed sensitivity analysis differential phenotypic response resistance endurance training showed model exercise regulates cell growth protein synthesis primarily signalling via mechanistic target rapamycin activated akt inhibited endurance exercise ampactivated protein kinase endurance exercise preferentially activates inflammation via reactive oxygen specie nuclear factor b signalling furthermore expected preferential activation mitochondrial biogenesis endurance exercise counterbalanced model protein kinase c response resistance training model provides new tool investigating crosstalk skeletal muscle signalling pathway activated endurance resistance exercise mechanism interaction interference effect endurance training resistance exercise outcome

116,Improving the production of carbamoyltobramycin by an industrial Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius through metabolic engineering.,"Tobramycin is an essential and extensively used broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic obtained through alkaline hydrolysis of carbamoyltobramycin, one of the fermentation products of Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius. To simplify the composition of fermentation products from industrial strain, the main byproduct apramycin was blocked by gene disruption and constructed a mutant mainly producing carbamoyltobramycin. The generation of antibiotics is significantly affected by the secondary metabolism of actinomycetes which could be controlled by modifying the pathway-specific regulatory proteins within the cluster. Within the tobramycin biosynthesis cluster, a transcriptional regulatory factor TobR belonging to the Lrp/AsnC family was identified. Based on the sequence and structural characteristics, tobR might encode a pathway-specific transcriptional regulatory factor during biosynthesis. Knockout and overexpression strains of tobR were constructed to investigate its role in carbamoyltobramycin production. Results showed that knockout of TobR increased carbamoyltobramycin biosynthesis by 22.35%, whereas its overexpression decreased carbamoyltobramycin production by 10.23%. In vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments confirmed that TobR interacts with DNA at the adjacent tobO promoter position. Strains overexpressing tobO with ermEp* promoter exhibited 36.36% increase, and tobO with kasOp* promoter exhibited 22.84% increase in carbamoyltobramycin titer. When the overexpressing of tobO and the knockout of tobR were combined, the production of carbamoyltobramycin was further enhanced. In the shake-flask fermentation, the titer reached 3.76 g/L, which was 42.42% higher than that of starting strain. Understanding the role of Lrp/AsnC family transcription regulators would be useful for other antibiotic biosynthesis in other actinomycetes.

117,"Kurarinone, a flavonoid from Radix Sophorae Flavescentis, inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in mouse bone marrow-derived monocyte/macrophages.","Inflammation-induced osteoclast proliferation is a crucial contributor to impaired bone metabolism. Kurarinone (KR), a flavonoid extracted from the Radix Sophorae Flavescentis, exhibits notable anti-inflammatory properties. Nevertheless, the precise influence of KR on osteoclast formation remains unclear. This study's objective was to assess the impact of KR on osteoclast activity in vitro and unravel its underlying mechanism. Initially, a target network for KR-osteoclastogenesis-osteoporosis was constructed using network pharmacology. Subsequently, the intersecting targets were identified through the Venny platform and a PPI network was created using Cytoscape 3.9.1. Key targets within the network were identified employing topological algorithms. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis were then performed on these targets to explore their specific functions and pathways. Additionally, molecular docking of potential core targets of KR was conducted, and the results were validated through cell experiments. A total of 83 target genes overlapped between KR and osteoclastogenesis-osteoporosis targets. Enrichment analysis revealed their role in inflammatory response, protein tyrosine kinase activity, osteoclast differentiation, and MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. PPI analysis and molecular docking demonstrate that key targets MAPK14 and MAPK8 exhibit more stable binding with KR compared to other proteins. In vitro experiments demonstrate that KR effectively inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption without cellular toxicity. It suppresses key osteoclast genes (NFATc1, c-Fos, TRAP, MMP9, Ctsk, Atp6v2), hinders IκB-α degradation, and inhibits ERK and JNK phosphorylation, while not affecting p38 phosphorylation. The results indicate that KR may inhibit osteoclast maturation and bone resorption by blocking NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways, suggesting its potential as a natural therapeutic agent for osteoporosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643449/,inflammationinduced osteoclast proliferation crucial contributor impaired bone metabolism kurarinone kr flavonoid extracted radix sophorae flavescentis exhibit notable antiinflammatory property nevertheless precise influence kr osteoclast formation remains unclear study objective ass impact kr osteoclast activity vitro unravel underlying mechanism initially target network krosteoclastogenesisosteoporosis constructed using network pharmacology subsequently intersecting target identified venny platform ppi network created using cytoscape key target within network identified employing topological algorithm go enrichment kegg pathway analysis performed target explore specific function pathway additionally molecular docking potential core target kr conducted result validated cell experiment total target gene overlapped kr osteoclastogenesisosteoporosis target enrichment analysis revealed role inflammatory response protein tyrosine kinase activity osteoclast differentiation mapk nfb signaling pathway ppi analysis molecular docking demonstrate key target mapk mapk exhibit stable binding kr compared protein vitro experiment demonstrate kr effectively inhibits osteoclast differentiation bone resorption without cellular toxicity suppresses key osteoclast gene nfatc cfo trap mmp ctsk atpv hinders ib degradation inhibits erk jnk phosphorylation affecting p phosphorylation result indicate kr may inhibit osteoclast maturation bone resorption blocking nfb mapk signaling pathway suggesting potential natural therapeutic agent osteoporosis
118,Adipose-derived stem cells promote glycolysis and peritoneal metastasis via TGF-β1/SMAD3/ANGPTL4 axis in colorectal cancer.,"Peritoneal metastasis, the third most common metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC), has a poor prognosis for the rapid progression and limited therapeutic strategy. However, the molecular characteristics and pathogenesis of CRC peritoneal metastasis are poorly understood. Here, we aimed to elucidate the action and mechanism of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), a prominent component of the peritoneal microenvironment, in CRC peritoneal metastasis formation. Database analysis indicated that ADSCs infiltration was increased in CRC peritoneal metastases, and high expression levels of ADSCs marker genes predicted a poor prognosis. Then we investigated the effect of ADSCs on CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. The results revealed that CRC cells co-cultured with ADSCs exhibited stronger metastatic property and anoikis resistance, and ADSCs boosted the intraperitoneal seeding of CRC cells. Furthermore, RNA sequencing was carried out to identify the key target gene, angiopoietin like 4 (ANGPTL4), which was upregulated in CRC specimens, especially in peritoneal metastases. Mechanistically, TGF-β1 secreted by ADSCs activated SMAD3 in CRC cells, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that SMAD3 facilitated ANGPTL4 transcription by directly binding to ANGPTL4 promoter. The ANGPTL4 upregulation was essential for ADSCs to promote glycolysis and anoikis resistance in CRC. Importantly, simultaneously targeting TGF-β signaling and ANGPTL4 efficiently reduced intraperitoneal seeding in vivo. In conclusion, this study indicates that tumor-infiltrating ADSCs promote glycolysis and anoikis resistance in CRC cells and ultimately facilitate peritoneal metastasis via the TGF-β1/SMAD3/ANGPTL4 axis.

Post-fertilization eggs were exposed to increasing concentrations of the drugs for six days. The expression levels of two genetic biomarkers for toxicity and four thyroid hormone-related gene pathways were measured.

Additionally, the thyroid hormone-related genes had different expression levels than the control, with the most significant changes observed in those larvae exposed to cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide.

122,Absence of E2f1 Negates Pro-osteogenic Impacts of p21 Absence.,"Loss of p21 leads to increased bone formation post-injury; however, the mechanism(s) by which this occurs remains undetermined. E2f1 is downstream of p21 and as a transcription factor can act directly on gene expression; yet it is unknown if E2f1 plays a role in the osteogenic effects observed when p21 is differentially regulated. In this study we aimed to investigate the interplay between p21 and E2f1 and determine if the pro-regenerative osteogenic effects observed with the loss of p21 are E2f1 dependent. To accomplish this, we employed knockout p21 and E2f1 mice and additionally generated a p21/E2f1 double knockout. These mice underwent burr-hole injuries to their proximal tibiae and healing was assessed over 7 days via microCT imaging. We found that p21 and E2f1 play distinct roles in bone regeneration where the loss of p21 increased trabecular bone formation and loss of E2f1 increased cortical bone formation, yet loss of E2f1 led to poorer bone repair overall. Furthermore, when E2f1 was absent, either individually or simultaneously with p21, there was a dramatic decrease of the number of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and chondrocytes at the site of injury compared to p21",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643416/,loss p lead increased bone formation postinjury however mechanism occurs remains undetermined ef downstream p transcription factor act directly gene expression yet unknown ef play role osteogenic effect observed p differentially regulated study aimed investigate interplay p ef determine proregenerative osteogenic effect observed loss p ef dependent accomplish employed knockout p ef mouse additionally generated pef double knockout mouse underwent burrhole injury proximal tibia healing assessed day via microct imaging found p ef play distinct role bone regeneration loss p increased trabecular bone formation loss ef increased cortical bone formation yet loss ef led poorer bone repair overall furthermore ef absent either individually simultaneously p dramatic decrease number osteoblast osteoclast chondrocytes site injury compared p

126,Navigating therapeutic strategies: HPV classification in head and neck cancer.,"The World Health Organisation recognised human papillomavirus (HPV) as the cause of multiple cancers, including head and neck cancers. HPV is a double-stranded DNA virus, and its viral gene expression can be controlled after infection by cellular and viral promoters. In cancer cells, the HPV genome is detected as either integrated into the host genome, episomal (extrachromosomal), or a mixture of integrated and episomal. Viral integration requires the breakage of both viral and host DNA, and the integration rate correlates with the level of DNA damage. Interestingly, patients with HPV-positive head and neck cancers generally have a good prognosis except for a group of patients with fully integrated HPV who show worst clinical outcomes. Those patients present with lowered expression of viral genes and limited infiltration of cytotoxic T cells. An impediment to effective therapy applications in the clinic is the sole testing for HPV positivity without considering the HPV integration status.

LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) is a member of the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) family of transcription factors and has been identified as a key regulator of embryonic development. In the present study, two LEC1-type genes from Arachis hypogeae were identified and designated as AhNF-YB1 and AhNF-YB10; these genes belong to subgenome A and subgenome B, respectively. The functions of AhNF-YB1 and AhNF-YB10 were investigated by complementation analysis of their defective phenotypes of the Arabidopsis lec1-2 mutant and by ectopic expression in wild-type Arabidopsis. The results indicated that both AhNF-YB1 and AhNF-YB10 participate in regulating embryogenesis, embryo development, and reserve deposition in cotyledons and that they have partial functional redundancy. In contrast, AhNF-YB10 complemented almost all the defective phenotypes of lec1-2 in terms of embryonic morphology and hypocotyl length, while AhNF-YB1 had only a partial effect. In addition, 30-40% of the seeds of the AhNF-YB1 transformants exhibited a decreasing germination ratio and longevity. Therefore, appropriate spatiotemporal expression of these genes is necessary for embryo morphogenesis at the early development stage and is responsible for seed maturation at the mid-late development stage. On the other hand, overexpression of AhNF-YB1 or AhNF-YB10 at the middle to late stages of Arabidopsis seed development improved the weight, oil content, and fatty acid composition of the transgenic seeds. Moreover, the expression levels of several genes associated with fatty acid synthesis and embryogenesis were significantly greater in developing AhNF-YB10-overexpressing seeds than in control seeds. This study provides a theoretical basis for breeding oilseed crops with high yields and high oil content.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643320/,two peanut lectype gene exhibit partial functional redundancy ahnfyb could complement almost defective phenotype lec term embryonic morphology ahnfyb could partially affect phenotype leafy cotyledon lec member nuclear factor nfy family transcription factor identified key regulator embryonic development present study two lectype gene arachis hypogeae identified designated ahnfyb ahnfyb gene belong subgenome subgenome b respectively function ahnfyb ahnfyb investigated complementation analysis defective phenotype arabidopsis lec mutant ectopic expression wildtype arabidopsis result indicated ahnfyb ahnfyb participate regulating embryogenesis embryo development reserve deposition cotyledon partial functional redundancy contrast ahnfyb complemented almost defective phenotype lec term embryonic morphology hypocotyl length ahnfyb partial effect addition seed ahnfyb transformants exhibited decreasing germination ratio longevity therefore appropriate spatiotemporal expression gene necessary embryo morphogenesis early development stage responsible seed maturation midlate development stage hand overexpression ahnfyb ahnfyb middle late stage arabidopsis seed development improved weight oil content fatty acid composition transgenic seed moreover expression level several gene associated fatty acid synthesis embryogenesis significantly greater developing ahnfyboverexpressing seed control seed study provides theoretical basis breeding oilseed crop high yield high oil content
128,Haemostatic gene variations in cervical cancer-associated venous thrombosis: considerations for clinical strategies.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a life-threatening haemostatic disease frequently diagnosed among the cancer population. The Khorana Score is currently the primal risk assessment model to stratify oncological patients according to their susceptibility to VTE, however, it displays a limited performance. Meanwhile, intensive research on VTE pathophysiology in the general population has uncovered a range of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the condition. Nonetheless, their predictive ability concerning cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) is controversial. Cervical cancer (CC) patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy often experience VTE, which negatively affects their survival. Thus, aiming for an improvement in thromboprophylaxis, new thrombotic biomarkers, including SNPs, are currently under investigation. In this study, the predictive capability of haemostatic gene SNPs on CC-related VTE and their prognostic value regardless of VTE were explored. Six SNPs in haemostatic genes were evaluated. A total of 401 CC patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy were enrolled in a retrospective cohort study. The implications for the time to VTE occurrence and overall survival (OS) were assessed. CAT considerably impacted the CC patients' OS (log-rank test, P < 0.001). SERPINE1 rs2070682 (T > C) showed a significant association with the risk of CC-related VTE (CC/CT vs. TT, log-rank test, P = 0.002; C allele, Cox model, hazard ratio (HR) = 6.99 and P = 0.009), while F2 rs1799963 (G > A) demonstrated an important prognostic value regardless of VTE (AA/AG vs. GG, log-rank test, P = 0.020; A allele, Cox model, HR = 2.76 and P = 0.026). For the remaining SNPs, no significant associations were detected. The polymorphisms SERPINE1 rs2070682 and F2 rs1799963 could be valuable tools in clinical decision-making, aiding in thromboprophylaxis and CC management, respectively.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643313/,venous thromboembolism vte lifethreatening haemostatic disease frequently diagnosed among cancer population khorana score currently primal risk assessment model stratify oncological patient according susceptibility vte however display limited performance meanwhile intensive research vte pathophysiology general population uncovered range singlenucleotide polymorphism snp associated condition nonetheless predictive ability concerning cancerassociated thrombosis cat controversial cervical cancer cc patient undergoing chemoradiotherapy often experience vte negatively affect survival thus aiming improvement thromboprophylaxis new thrombotic biomarkers including snp currently investigation study predictive capability haemostatic gene snp ccrelated vte prognostic value regardless vte explored six snp haemostatic gene evaluated total cc patient undergoing chemoradiotherapy enrolled retrospective cohort study implication time vte occurrence overall survival o assessed cat considerably impacted cc patient o logrank test p serpine r c showed significant association risk ccrelated vte ccct v tt logrank test p c allele cox model hazard ratio hr p f r g demonstrated important prognostic value regardless vte aaag v gg logrank test p allele cox model hr p remaining snp significant association detected polymorphism serpine r f r could valuable tool clinical decisionmaking aiding thromboprophylaxis cc management respectively

131,8-Cl-Ado and 8-NH,"Targeting the metabolic dependencies of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells is a promising therapeutical strategy. In particular, the cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway (C/M) is significantly altered in AML cells compared to healthy blood cells. Moreover, methionine has been identified as one of the dominant amino acid dependencies of AML cells. Through RNA-seq, we found that the two nucleoside analogs 8-chloro-adenosine (8CA) and 8-amino-adenosine (8AA) significantly suppress the C/M pathway in AML cells, and methionine-adenosyltransferase-2A (MAT2A) is one of most significantly downregulated genes. Additionally, mass spectrometry analysis revealed that Venetoclax (VEN), a BCL-2 inhibitor recently approved by the FDA for AML treatment, significantly decreases the intracellular level of methionine in AML cells. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that combining 8CA or 8AA with VEN can efficiently target the Methionine-MAT2A-S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) axis in AML. Our results demonstrate that VEN and 8CA/8AA synergistically decrease the SAM biosynthesis and effectively target AML cells both in vivo and in vitro. These findings suggest the promising potential of combining 8CA/8AA and VEN for AML treatment by inhibiting Methionine-MAT2A-SAM axis and provide a strong rationale for our recently activated clinical trial.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643304/,targeting metabolic dependency acute myeloid leukemia aml cell promising therapeutical strategy particular cysteine methionine metabolism pathway cm significantly altered aml cell compared healthy blood cell moreover methionine identified one dominant amino acid dependency aml cell rnaseq found two nucleoside analog chloroadenosine ca aminoadenosine aa significantly suppress cm pathway aml cell methionineadenosyltransferasea mata one significantly downregulated gene additionally mass spectrometry analysis revealed venetoclax ven bcl inhibitor recently approved fda aml treatment significantly decrease intracellular level methionine aml cell based finding hypothesized combining ca aa ven efficiently target methioninematasadenosylmethionine sam axis aml result demonstrate ven caaa synergistically decrease sam biosynthesis effectively target aml cell vivo vitro finding suggest promising potential combining caaa ven aml treatment inhibiting methioninematasam axis provide strong rationale recently activated clinical trial
132,NET-related gene signature for predicting AML prognosis.,"Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a malignant blood cancer with a high mortality rate. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) influence various tumor outcomes. However, NET-related genes (NRGs) in AML had not yet received much attention. This study focuses on the role of NRGs in AML and their interaction with the immunological microenvironment. The gene expression and clinical data of patients with AML were downloaded from the TCGA-LAML and GEO cohorts. We identified 148 NRGs through the published article. Univariate Cox regression was used to analyze the association of NRGs with overall survival (OS). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were utilized to assess the predictive efficacy of NRGs. Kaplan-Meier plots visualized survival estimates. ROC curves assessed the prognostic value of NRG-based features. A nomogram, integrating clinical information and prognostic scores of patients, was constructed using multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression models. Twenty-seven NRGs were found to significantly impact patient OS. Six NRGs-CFTR, ENO1, PARVB, DDIT4, MPO, LDLR-were notable for their strong predictive ability regarding patient survival. The ROC values for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 0.794, 0.781, and 0.911, respectively. In the training set (TCGA-LAML), patients in the high NRG risk group showed a poorer prognosis (p < 0.001), which was validated in two external datasets (GSE71014 and GSE106291). The 6-NRG signature and corresponding nomograms exhibit superior predictive accuracy, offering insights for pre-immune response evaluation and guiding future immuno-oncology treatments and drug selection for AML patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643300/,acute myeloid leukemia aml malignant blood cancer high mortality rate neutrophil extracellular trap net influence various tumor outcome however netrelated gene nrgs aml yet received much attention study focus role nrgs aml interaction immunological microenvironment gene expression clinical data patient aml downloaded tcgalaml geo cohort identified nrgs published article univariate cox regression used analyze association nrgs overall survival o least absolute shrinkage selection operator utilized ass predictive efficacy nrgs kaplanmeier plot visualized survival estimate roc curve assessed prognostic value nrgbased feature nomogram integrating clinical information prognostic score patient constructed using multivariate logistic regression cox proportional hazard regression model twentyseven nrgs found significantly impact patient o six nrgscftr eno parvb ddit mpo ldlrwere notable strong predictive ability regarding patient survival roc value year survival rate respectively training set tcgalaml patient high nrg risk group showed poorer prognosis p validated two external datasets gse gse nrg signature corresponding nomogram exhibit superior predictive accuracy offering insight preimmune response evaluation guiding future immunooncology treatment drug selection aml patient

134,Chromosome-level genome assembly of marine diatom Skeletonema tropicum.,"Skeletonema tropicum is a marine diatom of the genus Skeletonema that also includes many well-known species including S. marinoi. S. tropicum is a high temperature preferring species thriving in tropical ocean regions or temperate ocean regions during summer-autumn. However, mechanisms of ecological adaptation of S. tropicum remain poorly understood due partially to the lack of a high-quality whole genome assembly. Here, we report the first high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly for S. tropicum, using cutting-edge technologies including PacBio single molecular sequencing and high-throughput chromatin conformation capture. The assembled genome has a size of 78.78 Mb with a scaffold N50 of 3.17 Mb, anchored to 23 pseudo-chromosomes. In total, 20,613 protein-coding genes were predicted, of which 17,757 (86.14%) genes were functionally annotated. Collinearity analysis of the genomes of S. tropicum and S. marinoi revealed that these two genomes were highly homologous.

135,Spontaneous Akt2 deficiency in a colony of NOD mice exhibiting early diabetes.,"Diabetes constitutes a major public health problem, with dramatic consequences for patients. Both genetic and environmental factors were shown to contribute to the different forms of the disease. The monogenic forms, found both in humans and in animal models, specially help to decipher the role of key genes in the physiopathology of the disease. Here, we describe the phenotype of early diabetes in a colony of NOD mice, with spontaneous invalidation of Akt2, that we called HYP. The HYP mice were characterised by a strong and chronic hyperglycaemia, beginning around the age of one month, especially in male mice. The phenotype was not the consequence of the acceleration of the autoimmune response, inherent to the NOD background. Interestingly, in HYP mice, we observed hyperinsulinemia before hyperglycaemia occurred. We did not find any difference in the pancreas' architecture of the NOD and HYP mice (islets' size and staining for insulin and glucagon) but we detected a lower insulin content in the pancreas of HYP mice compared to NOD mice. These results give new insights about the role played by Akt2 in glucose homeostasis and argue for the ß cell failure being the primary event in the course of diabetes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643275/,diabetes constitutes major public health problem dramatic consequence patient genetic environmental factor shown contribute different form disease monogenic form found human animal model specially help decipher role key gene physiopathology disease describe phenotype early diabetes colony nod mouse spontaneous invalidation akt called hyp hyp mouse characterised strong chronic hyperglycaemia beginning around age one month especially male mouse phenotype consequence acceleration autoimmune response inherent nod background interestingly hyp mouse observed hyperinsulinemia hyperglycaemia occurred find difference pancreas architecture nod hyp mouse islet size staining insulin glucagon detected lower insulin content pancreas hyp mouse compared nod mouse result give new insight role played akt glucose homeostasis argue cell failure primary event course diabetes
136,Integrative analysis in head and neck cancer reveals distinct role of miRNome and methylome as tumour epigenetic drivers.,"Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide, with the relatively low 5-year survival rate, mainly because it is diagnosed at a late stage. Infection with HPV is a well known aetiology, which affects the nature of these cancers and patients' survival. Besides, it is considered that the main driving force for this type of cancer could be epigenetics. In this study we aimed to find potential epigenetic biomarkers, by integrating miRNome, methylome, and transcriptome analyses. From the fresh head and neck cancer tissue samples, we chose a group for miRNome, methylome and transcriptome profiling, in comparison to adequate control samples. Bioinformatics analyses are performed in R v4.2.2. Count normalisation and group differential expression for mRNA and the previously obtained miRNA count data was performed with DESeq2 v1.36. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed and visualised using gProfiler2 v0.2.1 Identification of miRNA targets was performed by querying in miRTarBase using multiMiR v1.18.0. Annotation of CpG sites merging into islands was obtained from RnBeads.hg19 v1.28.0. package. For the integrative analysis we performed kmeans clustering using stats v4.2.2 package, using 8-12 clusters and nstart 100. We found that transcriptome analysis divides samples into cancers and controls clusters, with no relation to HPV status or cancer anatomical location. Differentially expressed genes (n = 2781) were predominantly associated with signalling pathways of tumour progression. We identified a cluster of genes under the control of the transcription factor E2F that are significantly underexpressed in cancer tissue, as well as T cell immunity genes and genes related to regulation of transcription. Among overexpressed genes in tumours we found those that belong to cell cycle regulation and vasculature. A small number of genes were found significantly differentially expressed in HPV-positive versus HPV-negative tumours (for example NEFH, ZFR2, TAF7L, ZNF541, and TYMS). In this comprehensive study on an overlapping set of samples where the integration of miRNome, methylome and transcriptome analysis were performed for head and neck cancer, we demonstrated that the majority of genes were associated exclusively with miRNome or methylome and, to a lesser extent, under the control of both epigenetic mechanisms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643268/,head neck cancer sixth common malignancy worldwide relatively low year survival rate mainly diagnosed late stage infection hpv well known aetiology affect nature cancer patient survival besides considered main driving force type cancer could epigenetics study aimed find potential epigenetic biomarkers integrating mirnome methylome transcriptome analysis fresh head neck cancer tissue sample chose group mirnome methylome transcriptome profiling comparison adequate control sample bioinformatics analysis performed r v count normalisation group differential expression mrna previously obtained mirna count data performed deseq v gene set enrichment analysis performed visualised using gprofiler v identification mirna target performed querying mirtarbase using multimir v annotation cpg site merging island obtained rnbeadshg v package integrative analysis performed kmeans clustering using stats v package using cluster nstart found transcriptome analysis divide sample cancer control cluster relation hpv status cancer anatomical location differentially expressed gene n predominantly associated signalling pathway tumour progression identified cluster gene control transcription factor ef significantly underexpressed cancer tissue well cell immunity gene gene related regulation transcription among overexpressed gene tumour found belong cell cycle regulation vasculature small number gene found significantly differentially expressed hpvpositive versus hpvnegative tumour example nefh zfr tafl znf tyms comprehensive study overlapping set sample integration mirnome methylome transcriptome analysis performed head neck cancer demonstrated majority gene associated exclusively mirnome methylome lesser extent control epigenetic mechanism

139,Alfalfa xeno-miR159a regulates bovine mammary epithelial cell proliferation and milk protein synthesis by targeting PTPRF.,"Milk protein content is an important index to evaluate the quality and nutrition of milk. Accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in bovine lactation, but little is known regarding the cross-kingdom regulatory roles of plant-derived exogenous miRNAs (xeno-miRNAs) in milk protein synthesis, particularly the underlying molecular mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to explore the regulatory mechanism of alfalfa-derived xeno-miRNAs on proliferation and milk protein synthesis in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs). Our previous study showed that alfalfa miR159a (mtr-miR159a, xeno-miR159a) was highly expressed in alfalfa, and the abundance of mtr-miR159a was significantly lower in serum and whey from high-protein-milk dairy cows compared with low-protein-milk dairy cows. In this study, mRNA expression was detected by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), and casein content was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected using the cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining, western blot, and flow cytometry. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to determine the regulation of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type F (PTPRF) by xeno-miR159a. We found that xeno-miR159a overexpression inhibited proliferation of BMEC and promoted cell apoptosis. Besides, xeno-miR159a overexpression decreased β-casein abundance, and increased α-casein and κ-casein abundance in BMECs. Dual-luciferase reporter assay result confirmed that PTPRF is a target gene of xeno-miR159a.

140,Detection and genomic characterization of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli harboring tet(X4) in black kites (Milvus migrans) in Pakistan.,"The emergence of plasmid-mediated tigecycline resistance gene tet(X4) among clinically relevant bacteria has promoted significant concerns, as tigecycline is considered a last-resort drug against serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. We herein focused on the isolation and molecular characterization of tet(X4)-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) in wild bird populations with anthropogenic interaction in Faisalabad, Pakistan. A total of 150 birds including black kites (Milvus migrans) and house crows (Corvus splendens) were screened for the presence of tigecycline resistance K. pneumoniae and E. coli. We found two K. pneumoniae and one E. coli isolate carrying tet(X4) originating from black kites. A combination of short- and long-read sequencing strategies showed that tet(X4) was located on a broad host range IncFII plasmid family in K. pneumoniae isolates whereas on an IncFII-IncFIB hybrid plasmid in E. coli. We also found an integrative and conjugative element ICEKp2 in K. pneumoniae isolate KP8336. We demonstrate the first description of tet(X4) gene in the WHO critical-priority pathogen K. pneumoniae among wild birds. The convergence of tet(X4) and virulence associated ICEKp2 in a wild bird with known anthropogenic contact should be further investigated to evaluate the potential epidemiological implications.

142,"The overlooked evolutionary dynamics of 16S rRNA revises its role as the ""gold standard"" for bacterial species identification.","The role of 16S rRNA has been and largely remains crucial for the identification of microbial organisms. Although 16S rRNA could certainly be described as one of the most studied sequences ever, the current view of it remains somewhat ambiguous. While some consider 16S rRNA to be a variable marker with resolution power down to the strain level, others consider them to be living fossils that carry information about the origin of domains of cellular life. We show that 16S rRNA is clearly an evolutionarily very rigid sequence, making it a largely unique and irreplaceable marker, but its applicability beyond the genus level is highly limited. Interestingly, it seems that the evolutionary rigidity is not driven by functional constraints of the sequence (RNA-protein interactions), but rather results from the characteristics of the host organism. Our results suggest that, at least in some lineages, Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) within genera plays an important role for the evolutionary non-dynamics (stasis) of 16S rRNA. Such genera exhibit an apparent lack of diversification at the 16S rRNA level in comparison to the rest of a genome.

143,Alterations of the duodenal mucosal microbiome in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is associated with altered gut microbiota; however, there has been a focus on fecal samples, which are not representative of the entire digestive tract. Mucosal biopsies of the descending duodenum were collected. Five regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified and sequenced. Other assessments conducted on the study subjects included body mass index, transient elastography, liver enzymes, and lipid profile. Fifty-one subjects (36 with MASLD and 15 controls) were evaluated. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding alpha- or beta-diversity of the duodenal mucosal microbiota.

144,Small GTPase Rab7 is involved in stress adaptation to carbon starvation to ensure the induced cellulase biosynthesis in Trichoderma reesei.,"The saprophytic filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei represents one of the most prolific cellulase producers. The bulk production of lignocellulolytic enzymes by T. reesei not only relies on the efficient transcription of cellulase genes but also their efficient secretion after being translated. However, little attention has been paid to the functional roles of the involved secretory pathway in the high-level production of cellulases in T. reesei. Rab GTPases are key regulators in coordinating various vesicle trafficking associated with the eukaryotic secretory pathway. Specifically, Rab7 is a representative GTPase regulating the transition of the early endosome to the late endosome followed by its fusion to the vacuole as well as homotypic vacuole fusion. Although crosstalk between the endosomal/vacuolar pathway and the secretion pathway has been reported, the functional role of Rab7 in cellulase production in T. reesei remains unknown.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643207/,saprophytic filamentous fungus trichoderma reesei represents one prolific cellulase producer bulk production lignocellulolytic enzyme reesei relies efficient transcription cellulase gene also efficient secretion translated however little attention paid functional role involved secretory pathway highlevel production cellulases reesei rab gtpases key regulator coordinating various vesicle trafficking associated eukaryotic secretory pathway specifically rab representative gtpase regulating transition early endosome late endosome followed fusion vacuole well homotypic vacuole fusion although crosstalk endosomalvacuolar pathway secretion pathway reported functional role rab cellulase production reesei remains unknown

147,N4BP1 functions as a dimerization-dependent linear ubiquitin reader which regulates TNF signalling.,"Signalling through TNFR1 modulates proinflammatory gene transcription and programmed cell death, and its impairment causes autoimmune diseases and cancer. NEDD4-binding protein 1 (N4BP1) is a critical suppressor of proinflammatory cytokine production that acts as a regulator of innate immune signalling and inflammation. However, our current understanding about the molecular properties that enable N4BP1 to exert its suppressive potential remain limited. Here, we show that N4BP1 is a novel linear ubiquitin reader that negatively regulates NFκB signalling by its unique dimerization-dependent ubiquitin-binding module that we named LUBIN. Dimeric N4BP1 strategically positions two non-selective ubiquitin-binding domains to ensure preferential recognition of linear ubiquitin. Under proinflammatory conditions, N4BP1 is recruited to the nascent TNFR1 signalling complex, where it regulates duration of proinflammatory signalling in LUBIN-dependent manner. N4BP1 deficiency accelerates TNFα-induced cell death by increasing complex II assembly. Under proapoptotic conditions, caspase-8 mediates proteolytic processing of N4BP1, resulting in rapid degradation of N4BP1 by the 26 S proteasome, and acceleration of apoptosis. In summary, our findings demonstrate that N4BP1 dimerization creates a novel type of ubiquitin reader that selectively recognises linear ubiquitin which enables the timely and coordinated regulation of TNFR1-mediated inflammation and cell death.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643192/,signalling tnfr modulates proinflammatory gene transcription programmed cell death impairment cause autoimmune disease cancer neddbinding protein nbp critical suppressor proinflammatory cytokine production act regulator innate immune signalling inflammation however current understanding molecular property enable nbp exert suppressive potential remain limited show nbp novel linear ubiquitin reader negatively regulates nfb signalling unique dimerizationdependent ubiquitinbinding module named lubin dimeric nbp strategically position two nonselective ubiquitinbinding domain ensure preferential recognition linear ubiquitin proinflammatory condition nbp recruited nascent tnfr signalling complex regulates duration proinflammatory signalling lubindependent manner nbp deficiency accelerates tnfinduced cell death increasing complex ii assembly proapoptotic condition caspase mediates proteolytic processing nbp resulting rapid degradation nbp proteasome acceleration apoptosis summary finding demonstrate nbp dimerization creates novel type ubiquitin reader selectively recognises linear ubiquitin enables timely coordinated regulation tnfrmediated inflammation cell death

Here, we identify 7 families presenting a new cardiac entity associated with a heterozygous deletion of 2 CTCF binding sites on 4q25, inducing TAD fusion and chromatin conformation remodeling. The CTCF binding sites are located in a gene desert at 1 Mb from the Paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 gene (PITX2). By introducing the ortholog of the human deletion in the mouse genome, we recapitulate the patient phenotype and characterize an opposite dysregulation of PITX2 expression in the sinoatrial node (ectopic activation) and ventricle (reduction), respectively. Chromatin conformation assay performed in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes harboring the minimal deletion identified in family#1 reveals a conformation remodeling and fusion of TADs.

156,A novel variant in NSUN2 causes intellectual disability in a Chinese family.,"NSUN2-intellectual disability syndrome, also known as intellectual disability type 5 (MRT5), is an autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by intellectual disability (ID), postnatal growth retardation, dysmorphic facies, microcephaly, short stature, developmental delay, language impairment and other congenital abnormalities. The disease is caused by mutations in the NSUN2 gene, which encodes a tRNA cytosine methyltransferase that has an important role in spindle assembly during mitosis and chromosome segregation. In this study, we recruited a family that had two individuals with ID. Whole exome sequencing was performed to identify a homozygous frameshift variant (c.1171_1175delACCAT(p.Thr391fs*18*)) in NSUN2 (NM_017755.5) in the proband. The varint was confirmed as segregating in his affected brother and his parents by Sanger sequencing. The individuals that we described showed a similar dysmorphology profile to that associated with MRT5. To analyze the correlations between genotypes of NSUN2 and phenotypes of individuals with ID, we examined 17 variants and the associated phenotypes from 32 ID individuals in current and previous studies. We concluded that mutations in NSUN2 cause a wide range of phenotypic defects. Although some clinical manifestations were highly variable, the core phenotypes associated with NSUN2 mutations were dysmorphic facies, microcephaly, short stature, ID, growth restriction, language impairment, hypotonia and delayed puberty.

160,Scalable protein production by Komagataella phaffii enabled by ARS plasmids and carbon source-based selection.,"Most recombinant Komagataella phaffii (Pichia pastoris) strains for protein production are generated by genomic integration of expression cassettes.

168,Impact of the inaccessible genome on genotype imputation and genome-wide association studies.,"Genotype imputation is widely used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, both the genotyping chips and imputation reference panels are dependent on next-generation sequencing (NGS). Due to the nature of NGS, some regions of the genome are inaccessible to sequencing. To date, there has been no complete evaluation of these regions and their impact on the identification of associations in GWAS remains unclear. In this study, we systematically assess the extent to which variants in inaccessible regions are underrepresented on genotyping chips and imputation reference panels, in GWAS results and in variant databases. We also determine the proportion of genes located in inaccessible regions and compare the results across variant masks defined by the 1000 Genomes Project and the TOPMed program. Overall, fewer variants were observed in inaccessible regions in all categories analyzed. Depending on the mask used and normalized for region size, only 4%-17% of the genotyped variants are located in inaccessible regions and 52 to 581 genes were almost completely inaccessible. From the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study, we present a case study of an association located in an inaccessible region that is driven by genotyped variants and cannot be reproduced by imputation in GRCh37. We conclude that genotyping, NGS, genotype imputation and downstream analyses such as GWAS and fine mapping are systematically biased in inaccessible regions, due to missed variants and spurious associations.

171,Expression of an endo-rhamnogalacturonase from Aspergillus aculeatus enhances release of Arabidopsis transparent mucilage.,"Mucilage is a gelatinous and sticky hydrophilic polysaccharide released from epidermal cells of seed coat after the hydration of mature seeds and is composed primarily of unbranched rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I). In this study, we produced a recombinant endo-RG-I hydrolase from Aspergillus aculeatus (AaRhgA) in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and examined its substrate preference for pyridylaminated (PA) RG-I with the various degrees of polymerization (DP). Recombinant AaRhgA requires PA-RG-I with a DP of 10 or higher for its hydrolase activity. We heterologously expressed the AarhgA gene under the strong constitutive promoter, cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, in Arabidopsis thaliana. In a series of biochemical analyses of each mucilage fraction released from the water-imbibed seeds of the transgenic plants, we found the enhanced deposition of the transparent mucilage layer that existed in the peripheral regions of the adherent mucilage and was not stained with ruthenium red.

172,Spatial enrichment and genomic analyses reveal the link of NOMO1 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe motor neuron disease with uncertain genetic predisposition in most sporadic cases. Spatial architecture of cell types and gene expression is the basis of cell-cell interactions, biological function and disease pathology, but is not well investigated in human motor cortex, a key ALS relevant brain region. Recent studies indicated single nucleus transcriptomic features of motor neuron vulnerability in ALS motor cortex. However, it remains largely unclear what is the brain regional vulnerability of ALS-associated genes, and what is the genetic link between region-specific genes and ALS risk. Here, we developed an entropy-weighted differential gene expression matrix-based tool (SpatialE) to identify the spatial enrichment of gene sets in spatial transcriptomics (ST). We benchmarked SpatialE against another enrichment tool (Multimodal Intersection Analysis, MIA) using ST data from both human and mouse brain tissues. To investigate regional vulnerability, we analyzed three human motor cortex and two dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues for spatial enrichment of ALS-associated genes. We also used Cell2location to estimate the abundance of cell types in ALS-related cortex layers. To dissect the link of regionally expressed genes and ALS risk, we performed burden analyses of rare loss-of-function (LOF) variants detected by whole-genome sequencing in ALS patients and controls, and then analyzed differential gene expression in the TargetALS RNA-seq dataset. SpatialE showed more accurate and specific spatial enrichment of regional cell type markers than MIA in both mouse brain and human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Spatial transcriptomic analyses of human motor cortex showed heterogenous cell types and spatial gene expression profiles. We found that 260 manually curated ALS-associated genes are significantly enriched in layer 5 (L5) motor cortex, with abundant expression of upper motor neurons and L5 excitatory neurons.

176,Binding evolution of the Dengue Virus Envelope against DC-SIGN: A combined approach of phylogenetics and molecular dynamics analyses over 30 years of Dengue Virus in Brazil.,"The Red Queen Hypothesis (RQH), derived from Lewis Carroll's ""Through the Looking-Glass"", postulates that organisms must continually adapt in response to each other to maintain relative fitness. Within the context of host-pathogen interactions, the RQH implies an evolutionary arms race, wherein viruses evolve to exploit hosts and hosts evolve to resist viral invasion. This study delves into the dynamics of the RQH in the context of virus-cell interactions, specifically focusing on virus receptors and cell receptors. We observed multiple virus-host systems and noted patterns of co-evolution. As viruses evolved receptor-binding proteins to effectively engage with cell receptors, cells countered by altering their receptor genes. This ongoing mutual adaptation cycle has influenced the molecular intricacies of receptor-ligand interactions. Our data supports the RQH as a driving force behind the diversification and specialization of both viral and host cell receptors. Understanding this co-evolutionary dance offers insights into the unpredictability of emerging viral diseases and potential therapeutic interventions. Future research is crucial to dissect the nuanced molecular changes and the broader ecological consequences of this ever-evolving battle. Here, we combine phylogenetic inferences, structural modeling, and molecular dynamics analyses to describe the epidemiological characteristics of major Brazilian DENV strains that circulated from 1990 to 2022 from a combined perspective, thus providing us with a more detailed picture on the dynamics of such interactions over time.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642883/,red queen hypothesis rqh derived lewis carroll lookingglass postulate organism must continually adapt response maintain relative fitness within context hostpathogen interaction rqh implies evolutionary arm race wherein virus evolve exploit host host evolve resist viral invasion study delf dynamic rqh context viruscell interaction specifically focusing virus receptor cell receptor observed multiple virushost system noted pattern coevolution virus evolved receptorbinding protein effectively engage cell receptor cell countered altering receptor gene ongoing mutual adaptation cycle influenced molecular intricacy receptorligand interaction data support rqh driving force behind diversification specialization viral host cell receptor understanding coevolutionary dance offer insight unpredictability emerging viral disease potential therapeutic intervention future research crucial dissect nuanced molecular change broader ecological consequence everevolving battle combine phylogenetic inference structural modeling molecular dynamic analysis describe epidemiological characteristic major brazilian denv strain circulated combined perspective thus providing u detailed picture dynamic interaction time
177,The alternative enzymes-bearing tunicates lack multiple widely distributed genes coding for peripheral OXPHOS subunits.,"The respiratory chain alternative enzymes (AEs) NDX and AOX from the tunicate Ciona intestinalis (Ascidiacea) have been xenotopically expressed and characterized in human cells in culture and in the model organisms Drosophila melanogaster and mouse, with the purpose of developing bypass therapies to combat mitochondrial diseases in human patients with defective complexes I and III/IV, respectively. The fact that the genes coding for NDX and AOX have been lost from genomes of evolutionarily successful animal groups, such as vertebrates and insects, led us to investigate if the composition of the respiratory chain of Ciona and other tunicates differs significantly from that of humans and Drosophila, to accommodate the natural presence of AEs. We have failed to identify in tunicate genomes fifteen orthologous genes that code for subunits of the respiratory chain complexes; all of these putatively missing subunits are peripheral to complexes I, III and IV in mammals, and many are important for complex-complex interaction in supercomplexes (SCs), such as NDUFA11, UQCR11 and COX7A. Modeling of all respiratory chain subunit polypeptides of Ciona indicates significant structural divergence that is consistent with the lack of these fifteen clear orthologous subunits. We also provide evidence using Ciona AOX expressed in Drosophila that this AE cannot access the coenzyme Q pool reduced by complex I, but it is readily available to oxidize coenzyme Q molecules reduced by glycerophosphate oxidase, a mitochondrial inner membrane-bound dehydrogenase that is not involved in SCs. Altogether, our results suggest that Ciona AEs might have evolved in a mitochondrial inner membrane environment much different from that of mammals and insects, possibly without SCs; this correlates with the preferential functional interaction between these AEs and non-SC dehydrogenases in heterologous mammalian and insect systems. We discuss the implications of these findings for the applicability of Ciona AEs in human bypass therapies and for our understanding of the evolution of animal respiratory chain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642871/,respiratory chain alternative enzyme aes ndx aox tunicate ciona intestinalis ascidiacea xenotopically expressed characterized human cell culture model organism drosophila melanogaster mouse purpose developing bypass therapy combat mitochondrial disease human patient defective complex iiiiv respectively fact gene coding ndx aox lost genome evolutionarily successful animal group vertebrate insect led u investigate composition respiratory chain ciona tunicate differs significantly human drosophila accommodate natural presence aes failed identify tunicate genome fifteen orthologous gene code subunit respiratory chain complex putatively missing subunit peripheral complex iii iv mammal many important complexcomplex interaction supercomplexes sc ndufa uqcr coxa modeling respiratory chain subunit polypeptide ciona indicates significant structural divergence consistent lack fifteen clear orthologous subunit also provide evidence using ciona aox expressed drosophila ae access coenzyme q pool reduced complex readily available oxidize coenzyme q molecule reduced glycerophosphate oxidase mitochondrial inner membranebound dehydrogenase involved sc altogether result suggest ciona aes might evolved mitochondrial inner membrane environment much different mammal insect possibly without sc correlate preferential functional interaction aes nonsc dehydrogenases heterologous mammalian insect system discus implication finding applicability ciona aes human bypass therapy understanding evolution animal respiratory chain

182,"Intermittent fasting, exercise and dietary modification induce unique transcriptomic signatures of multiple tissues governing metabolic homeostasis during weight loss and rebound weight gain.","Obesity and its related metabolic diseases bring great challenges to public health. In-depth understanding on the efficacy of weight-loss interventions is critical for long-term weight control. Our study demonstrated the comparable efficacy of exercise (EX), intermittent fasting (IF), or the change of daily diet from an unhealthy to a normal chow (DR) for weight reduction, but largely divergently affected metabolic status and transcriptome of subcutaneous fat, scapular brown fat, skeletal muscles and liver in high-fat-high-fructose diet (HFHF) induced obese mice. EX and IF reduced systematic inflammation, improved glucose and lipid metabolism in liver and muscle, and amino acid metabolism and thermogenesis in adipose tissues. EX exhibited broad regulatory effects on TCA cycle, carbon metabolism, thermogenesis, propanoate-, fatty acid and amino acid metabolism across multiple tissues. IF prominently affected genes involved in mitophagy and autophagy in adipose tissues and core genes involved in butanoate metabolism in liver. DR however failed to improve metabolic homeostasis and biological dysfunctions in obese mice. Notably, by exploring potential inter-organ communication, we identified an obesity-resistant-like gene profile that were strongly correlated with HFHF induced metabolic derangements and could predict the degree of weight regain induced by the follow-up HFHF diet. Among them, 12 genes (e.g., Gdf15, Tfrc, Cdv3, Map2k4 and Nqo1) were causally associated with human metabolic traits, i.e., BMI, body fat mass, HbA1C, fasting glucose and cholesterol.

184,Advances in nuclear proteostasis of metazoans.,"The proteostasis network and associated protein quality control (PQC) mechanisms ensure proteome functionality and are essential for cell survival. A distinctive feature of eukaryotic cells is their high degree of compartmentalization, requiring specific and adapted proteostasis networks for each compartment. The nucleus, essential for maintaining the integrity of genetic information and gene transcription, is one such compartment. While PQC mechanisms have been investigated for decades in the cytoplasm and the endoplasmic reticulum, our knowledge of nuclear PQC pathways is only emerging. Recent developments in the field have underscored the importance of spatially managing aberrant proteins within the nucleus. Upon proteotoxic stress, misfolded proteins and PQC effectors accumulate in various nuclear membrane-less organelles. Beyond bringing together effectors and substrates, the biophysical properties of these organelles allow novel PQC functions.

Autosomal dominant lamellar ichthyosis (ADLI) is a rare condition, and ASPRV1 was the only gene linked to ADLI to date. We identified a heterozygous variant (ENST00000686631.1:c.1372G>T, p.(Val458Phe)) in the NKPD1 gene in seven individuals from a four-generation German pedigree with generalized lamellar ichthyosis by whole exome sequencing. Segregation analysis confirmed its presence in affected individuals, resulting in a LOD score of 3.31. NKPD1 encodes the NTPase KAP Family P-Loop Domain-Containing Protein 1, implicated in the plasma membrane, its role in human disease is as yet unknown. Skin histology showed moderate acanthosis and compact orthohyperkeratosis, and the ultrastructure differed clearly from that in ASPRV1-ADLI. While NKPD1 mRNA expression increased during keratinocyte differentiation, stratum corneum ceramides exhibited no significant changes.

In this study, 3-, 12- and 18- month-old APP/PS1 mice and WT littermates underwent memory tests, then synapse-related gene expression, class 1 histone deacetylases (HDACs) abundance, and H3K9ac levels at target gene promoters, were evaluated in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Our results showed recognition and long-term spatial memory impaired in 18-month-old WT mice and recognition, short-term working, and long-term spatial reference memory deficits in 12-and 18- month-old APP/PS1 mice. The memory impairments are associated with synapse-related gene nr2a, glur1, glur2, psd95 expression, HDAC abundance, and H3K9ac regulation. More specifically, HDAC 2 modulated synapse-related gene expression through H3K9ac at the gene promoters during aging and AD progression in the hippocampus. Conversely, HDAC 3 modulated synapse-related gene expression through H3K9ac at the gene promoters during AD progression in the PFC.

188,Architecture of β-Lactoglobulin Coating Modulates Bioinspired Alginate Dialdehyde-Gelatine/Polydopamine Scaffolds for Subchondral Bone Regeneration.,"In this study, we developed polydopamine (PDA)-functionalized alginate dialdehyde-gelatine (ADA-GEL) scaffolds for subchondral bone regeneration. These polymeric scaffolds were then coated with β-Lactoglobulin (β-LG) at concentrations of 1 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml. Morphological analysis indicated a homogeneous coating of the β-LG layer on the surface of network-like scaffolds. The β-LG-coated scaffolds exhibited improved swelling capacity as a function of the β-LG concentration. Compared to ADA-GEL/PDA scaffolds, the β-LG-coated scaffolds demonstrated delayed degradation and enhanced biomineralization. Here, a lower concentration of β-LG showed long-lasting stability and superior biomimetic hydroxyapatite mineralization. According to the theoretical findings, the single-state, representing the low concentration of β-LG, exhibited homogeneous distribution on the surface of the PDA, while the dimer-state (high concentration) displayed a high likelihood of uncontrolled interactions. β-LG-coated ADA-GEL/PDA scaffolds with a lower concentration of β-LG provided a biocompatible substrate that supported adhesion, proliferation, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) secretion of sheep bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, as well as increased expression of osteopontin (SPP1) and collagen type 1 (COL1A1) in human osteoblasts. These findings indicate the potential of protein-coated scaffolds for subchondral bone tissue regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study addresses a crucial aspect of osteochondral defect repair, emphasizing the pivotal role of subchondral bone regeneration. The development of polydopamine-functionalized alginate dialdehyde-gelatine (ADA-GEL) scaffolds, coated with β-Lactoglobulin (β-LG), represents a novel approach to potentially enhance subchondral bone repair. β-LG, a milk protein rich in essential amino acids and bioactive peptides, is investigated for its potential to promote subchondral bone regeneration. This research explores computationally and experimentally the influence of protein concentration on the ordered or irregular deposition, unravelling the interplay between coating structure, scaffold properties, and in-vitro performance.

189,CXXC5 drove inflammation and ovarian cancer proliferation via transcriptional activation of ZNF143 and EGR1.,"CXXC5, a zinc-finger protein, is known for its role in epigenetic regulation via binding to unmethylated CpG islands in gene promoters. As a transcription factor and epigenetic regulator, CXXC5 modulates various signaling processes and acts as a key coordinator. Altered expression or activity of CXXC5 has been linked to various pathological conditions, including tumorigenesis. Despite its known role in cancer, CXXC5's function and mechanism in ovarian cancer are unclear. We analyzed multiple public databases and found that CXXC5 is highly expressed in ovarian cancer, with high expression correlating with poor patient prognosis. We show that CXXC5 expression is regulated by oxygen concentration and is a direct target of HIF1A. CXXC5 is critical for maintaining the proliferative potential of ovarian cancer cells, with knockdown decreasing and overexpression increasing cell proliferation. Loss of CXXC5 led to inactivation of multiple inflammatory signaling pathways, while overexpression activated these pathways. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we confirmed ZNF143 and EGR1 as downstream transcription factors of CXXC5, mediating its proliferative potential in ovarian cancer. Our findings suggest that the CXXC5-ZNF143/EGR1 axis forms a network driving ovarian cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, and highlight CXXC5 as a potential therapeutic target for ovarian cancer treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642782/,cxxc zincfinger protein known role epigenetic regulation via binding unmethylated cpg island gene promoter transcription factor epigenetic regulator cxxc modulates various signaling process act key coordinator altered expression activity cxxc linked various pathological condition including tumorigenesis despite known role cancer cxxcs function mechanism ovarian cancer unclear analyzed multiple public database found cxxc highly expressed ovarian cancer high expression correlating poor patient prognosis show cxxc expression regulated oxygen concentration direct target hifa cxxc critical maintaining proliferative potential ovarian cancer cell knockdown decreasing overexpression increasing cell proliferation loss cxxc led inactivation multiple inflammatory signaling pathway overexpression activated pathway vitro vivo experiment confirmed znf egr downstream transcription factor cxxc mediating proliferative potential ovarian cancer finding suggest cxxcznfegr axis form network driving ovarian cell proliferation tumorigenesis highlight cxxc potential therapeutic target ovarian cancer treatment

194,Nitrogen fertilization modulates rice phyllosphere functional genes and pathogens through fungal communities.,"The phyllosphere is a vital yet often neglected habitat hosting diverse microorganisms with various functions. However, studies regarding how the composition and functions of the phyllosphere microbiome respond to agricultural practices, like nitrogen fertilization, are limited. This study investigated the effects of long-term nitrogen fertilization with different levels (CK, N90, N210, N330) on the functional genes and pathogens of the rice phyllosphere microbiome. Results showed that the relative abundance of many microbial functional genes in the rice phyllosphere was significantly affected by nitrogen fertilization, especially those involved in C fixation and denitrification genes. Different nitrogen fertilization levels have greater effects on fungal communities than bacteria communities in the rice phyllosphere, and network analysis and structural equation models further elucidate that fungal communities not only changed bacterial-fungal inter-kingdom interactions in the phyllosphere but also contributed to the variation of biogeochemical cycle potential. Besides, the moderate nitrogen fertilization level (N210) was associated with an enrichment of beneficial microbes in the phyllosphere, while also resulting in the lowest abundance of pathogenic fungi (1.14 %). In contrast, the highest abundance of pathogenic fungi (1.64 %) was observed in the highest nitrogen fertilization level (N330).

195,Transgenerational acclimation to acidified seawater and gene expression patterns in a sea urchin.,"Transgenerational responses of susceptible calcifying organisms to progressive ocean acidification are an important issue in reducing uncertainty of future predictions. In this study, a two-generation rearing experiment was conducted using mature Mesocentrotus nudus, a major edible sea urchin that occurs along the coasts of northern Japan. Morphological observations and comprehensive gene expression analysis (RNA-seq) of resulting larvae were performed to examine transgenerational acclimation to acidified seawater. Two generations of rearing experiments showed that larvae derived from parents acclimated to acidified seawater tended to have higher survival and show less reduction in body size when exposed to acidified seawater of the same pH, suggesting that a positive carry-over effect occurred. RNA-seq analysis showed that gene expression patterns of larvae originated from both acclimated and non-acclimated parents to acidified seawater tended to be different than control condition, and the gene expression pattern of larvae originated from acclimated parents was substantially different than that of larvae of non-acclimated and control parents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642751/,transgenerational response susceptible calcifying organism progressive ocean acidification important issue reducing uncertainty future prediction study twogeneration rearing experiment conducted using mature mesocentrotus nudus major edible sea urchin occurs along coast northern japan morphological observation comprehensive gene expression analysis rnaseq resulting larva performed examine transgenerational acclimation acidified seawater two generation rearing experiment showed larva derived parent acclimated acidified seawater tended higher survival show le reduction body size exposed acidified seawater ph suggesting positive carryover effect occurred rnaseq analysis showed gene expression pattern larva originated acclimated nonacclimated parent acidified seawater tended different control condition gene expression pattern larva originated acclimated parent substantially different larva nonacclimated control parent
196,Coping with salinity extremes: Gill transcriptome profiling in the black-chinned tilapia (Sarotherodon melanotheron).,"Steeper and sometimes extreme salinity gradients increasingly affect aquatic organisms because of climate change. Hypersalinity habitats demand powerful physiological adaptive strategies. Few teleost species have the capacity to spend their whole life cycle in salinities way over seawater levels. Focusing on the multifunctional gill, we unraveled the tilapia S. melanotheron key strategies to cope with different environmental conditions, ranging from freshwater up to hypersaline habitats. De novo transcriptome assembly based on RNAseq allowed for the analysis of 40,967 annotated transcripts among samples collected in three wild populations at 0, 40 and 80 ‰. A trend analysis of the expression patterns revealed responses across the salinity gradient with different gene pathways involved. Genes linked to ion transport, pH regulation and cell surface receptor signaling were mainly upregulated in the high salinity habitat. We identified tight junction proteins that were critical in high salinity habitats and that were different from the well-known tightening junctional proteins identified and expressed in fresh water. Expression profiles also suggest a change in the vascular tone that could be linked to an osmorespiratory compromise not only in fresh water, but also in high salinity environments. A striking downregulation of genes linked to the immune system and to the heat shock response was observed suggesting an energetic trade-off between immunity and acclimation/adaptation in the hypersaline habitat. The high expression of transcripts coding for immune and heat shock response in the freshwater habitat suggests the establishment of powerful mechanisms to protect gills from environmental threats and to maintain protein integrity. Non-directional expression trends were also detected with an upregulation of genes only in the hypersaline habitat (80 ‰) or only in the marine habitat (40 ‰). Unravel physiological strategies in S. melanotheron populations will help to better understand the molecular basis of fish euryhalinity in salinity-contrasted environments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642748/,steeper sometimes extreme salinity gradient increasingly affect aquatic organism climate change hypersalinity habitat demand powerful physiological adaptive strategy teleost specie capacity spend whole life cycle salinity way seawater level focusing multifunctional gill unraveled tilapia melanotheron key strategy cope different environmental condition ranging freshwater hypersaline habitat de novo transcriptome assembly based rnaseq allowed analysis annotated transcript among sample collected three wild population trend analysis expression pattern revealed response across salinity gradient different gene pathway involved gene linked ion transport ph regulation cell surface receptor signaling mainly upregulated high salinity habitat identified tight junction protein critical high salinity habitat different wellknown tightening junctional protein identified expressed fresh water expression profile also suggest change vascular tone could linked osmorespiratory compromise fresh water also high salinity environment striking downregulation gene linked immune system heat shock response observed suggesting energetic tradeoff immunity acclimationadaptation hypersaline habitat high expression transcript coding immune heat shock response freshwater habitat suggests establishment powerful mechanism protect gill environmental threat maintain protein integrity nondirectional expression trend also detected upregulation gene hypersaline habitat marine habitat unravel physiological strategy melanotheron population help better understand molecular basis fish euryhalinity salinitycontrasted environment
197,Differential impact of intermittent versus continuous treatment with clozapine on fatty acid metabolism in the brain of an MK-801-induced mouse model of schizophrenia.,"Continuous antipsychotic treatment is often recommended to prevent relapse in schizophrenia. However, the efficacy of antipsychotic treatment appears to diminish in patients with relapsed schizophrenia and the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Moreover, though the findings are inconclusive, several recent studies suggest that intermittent versus continuous treatment may not significantly differ in recurrence risk and therapeutic efficacy but potentially reduce the drug dose and side effects. Notably, disturbances in fatty acid (FA) metabolism are linked to the onset/relapse of schizophrenia, and patients with multi-episode schizophrenia have been reported to have reduced FA biosynthesis. We thus utilized an MK-801-induced animal model of schizophrenia to evaluate whether two treatment strategies of clozapine would affect drug response and FA metabolism differently in the brain. Schizophrenia-related behaviors were assessed through open field test (OFT) and prepulse inhibition (PPI) test, and FA profiles of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additionally, we measured gene expression levels of enzymes involved in FA synthesis. Both intermittent and continuous clozapine treatment reversed hypermotion and deficits in PPI in mice. Continuous treatment decreased total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and FAs in the PFC, whereas the intermittent administration increased n-6 PUFAs, SFAs and FAs compared to continuous administration. Meanwhile, continuous treatment reduced the expression of Fads1 and Elovl2, while intermittent treatment significantly upregulated them. This study discloses the novel findings that there was no significant difference in clozapine efficacy between continuous and intermittent administration, but intermittent treatment showed certain protective effects on phospholipid metabolism in the PFC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642730/,continuous antipsychotic treatment often recommended prevent relapse schizophrenia however efficacy antipsychotic treatment appears diminish patient relapsed schizophrenia underlying mechanism still unknown moreover though finding inconclusive several recent study suggest intermittent versus continuous treatment may significantly differ recurrence risk therapeutic efficacy potentially reduce drug dose side effect notably disturbance fatty acid fa metabolism linked onsetrelapse schizophrenia patient multiepisode schizophrenia reported reduced fa biosynthesis thus utilized mkinduced animal model schizophrenia evaluate whether two treatment strategy clozapine would affect drug response fa metabolism differently brain schizophreniarelated behavior assessed open field test oft prepulse inhibition ppi test fa profile prefrontal cortex pfc hippocampus analyzed gas chromatographymass spectrometry additionally measured gene expression level enzyme involved fa synthesis intermittent continuous clozapine treatment reversed hypermotion deficit ppi mouse continuous treatment decreased total polyunsaturated fatty acid pufas saturated fatty acid sfas fa pfc whereas intermittent administration increased n pufas sfas fa compared continuous administration meanwhile continuous treatment reduced expression fad elovl intermittent treatment significantly upregulated study discloses novel finding significant difference clozapine efficacy continuous intermittent administration intermittent treatment showed certain protective effect phospholipid metabolism pfc
198,A review of DNA nanoparticles-encapsulated drug/gene/protein for advanced controlled drug release: Current status and future perspective over emerging therapy approaches.,"In the last ten years, the field of nanomedicine has experienced significant progress in creating novel drug delivery systems (DDSs). An effective strategy involves employing DNA nanoparticles (NPs) as carriers to encapsulate drugs, genes, or proteins, facilitating regulated drug release. This abstract examines the utilization of DNA NPs and their potential applications in strategies for controlled drug release. Researchers have utilized the distinctive characteristics of DNA molecules, including their ability to self-assemble and their compatibility with living organisms, to create NPs specifically for the purpose of delivering drugs. The DNA NPs possess numerous benefits compared to conventional drug carriers, such as exceptional stability, adjustable dimensions and structure, and convenient customization. Researchers have successfully achieved a highly efficient encapsulation of different therapeutic agents by carefully designing their structure and composition. This advancement enables precise and targeted delivery of drugs. The incorporation of drugs, genes, or proteins into DNA NPs provides notable advantages in terms of augmenting therapeutic effectiveness while reducing adverse effects. DNA NPs serve as a protective barrier for the enclosed payloads, preventing their degradation and extending their duration in the body. The protective effect is especially vital for delicate biologics, such as proteins or gene-based therapies that could otherwise be vulnerable to enzymatic degradation or quick elimination. Moreover, the surface of DNA NPs can be altered to facilitate specific targeting towards particular tissues or cells, thereby augmenting the accuracy of delivery. A significant benefit of DNA NPs is their capacity to regulate the kinetics of drug release. Through the manipulation of the DNA NPs structure, scientists can regulate the rate at which the enclosed cargo is released, enabling a prolonged and regulated dispensation of medication. This control is crucial for medications with limited therapeutic ranges or those necessitating uninterrupted administration to attain optimal therapeutic results. In addition, DNA NPs have the ability to react to external factors, including alterations in temperature, pH, or light, which can initiate the release of the payload at precise locations or moments. This feature enhances the precision of drug release control. The potential uses of DNA NPs in the controlled release of medicines are extensive. The NPs have the ability to transport various therapeutic substances, for example, drugs, peptides, NAs (NAs), and proteins. They exhibit potential for the therapeutic management of diverse ailments, including cancer, genetic disorders, and infectious diseases. In addition, DNA NPs can be employed for targeted drug delivery, traversing biological barriers, and surpassing the constraints of conventional drug administration methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642693/,last ten year field nanomedicine experienced significant progress creating novel drug delivery system dds effective strategy involves employing dna nanoparticles np carrier encapsulate drug gene protein facilitating regulated drug release abstract examines utilization dna np potential application strategy controlled drug release researcher utilized distinctive characteristic dna molecule including ability selfassemble compatibility living organism create np specifically purpose delivering drug dna np posse numerous benefit compared conventional drug carrier exceptional stability adjustable dimension structure convenient customization researcher successfully achieved highly efficient encapsulation different therapeutic agent carefully designing structure composition advancement enables precise targeted delivery drug incorporation drug gene protein dna np provides notable advantage term augmenting therapeutic effectiveness reducing adverse effect dna np serve protective barrier enclosed payload preventing degradation extending duration body protective effect especially vital delicate biologics protein genebased therapy could otherwise vulnerable enzymatic degradation quick elimination moreover surface dna np altered facilitate specific targeting towards particular tissue cell thereby augmenting accuracy delivery significant benefit dna np capacity regulate kinetics drug release manipulation dna np structure scientist regulate rate enclosed cargo released enabling prolonged regulated dispensation medication control crucial medication limited therapeutic range necessitating uninterrupted administration attain optimal therapeutic result addition dna np ability react external factor including alteration temperature ph light initiate release payload precise location moment feature enhances precision drug release control potential us dna np controlled release medicine extensive np ability transport various therapeutic substance example drug peptide na na protein exhibit potential therapeutic management diverse ailment including cancer genetic disorder infectious disease addition dna np employed targeted drug delivery traversing biological barrier surpassing constraint conventional drug administration method
199,Goat milk exosomal microRNAs alleviate LPS-induced intestinal inflammation in mice.,"Intestinal inflammation is a common digestive system disease. Milk-derived exosomes can participate in intercellular communication and transport a variety of bioactive components, and the microRNAs (miRNAs) they carry play important roles in a variety of biological processes in the body. At present, the preventive effect and mechanism of action of goat milk exosomes and their derived miRNAs on intestinal inflammation are still unclear. In this study, the protective effect of goat milk exosomes on LPS-induced intestinal inflammation was investigated using mouse intestinal inflammation model and IEC-6 cell inflammation model. Small RNA sequencing was used to analyze the miRNA expression profile of goat milk exosomes. In this study, C-Exo and M-Exo alleviated intestinal inflammation by reducing the LPS-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines, inhibiting the increase in the NLRP3 protein and the activation of the TLR4/NFκB signaling pathway. C-Exo has a more significant inhibitory effect on them, and better therapeutic efficacy than M-Exo. Notably, the target genes of miRNAs in C-Exo and M-Exo were significantly enriched in immune-related pathways. Furthermore, their derived miR-26a-5p and miR-30a-5p were found to ameliorate the IEC-6 inflammatory response. These findings suggest that miRNAs in goat milk exosomes have the potential to attenuate LPS-induced intestinal inflammation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642690/,intestinal inflammation common digestive system disease milkderived exosomes participate intercellular communication transport variety bioactive component micrornas mirnas carry play important role variety biological process body present preventive effect mechanism action goat milk exosomes derived mirnas intestinal inflammation still unclear study protective effect goat milk exosomes lpsinduced intestinal inflammation investigated using mouse intestinal inflammation model iec cell inflammation model small rna sequencing used analyze mirna expression profile goat milk exosomes study cexo mexo alleviated intestinal inflammation reducing lpsinduced release proinflammatory cytokine inhibiting increase nlrp protein activation tlrnfb signaling pathway cexo significant inhibitory effect better therapeutic efficacy mexo notably target gene mirnas cexo mexo significantly enriched immunerelated pathway furthermore derived mirap mirap found ameliorate iec inflammatory response finding suggest mirnas goat milk exosomes potential attenuate lpsinduced intestinal inflammation

The misuse of antibiotics exacerbates skin infections by generating multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this study, we developed chemo-photothermal therapy (chemo-PTT) based on near-infrared (NIR)-irradiated chitosan/gold nanorod (GNR) clusters as anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) agents. The nanocomposites exhibited an average size of 223 nm with a surface charge of 36 mV. These plasmonic nanocomposites demonstrated on-demand and rapid hyperthermal action under NIR. The combined effect of positive charge and PTT by NIR-irradiated nanocomposites resulted in a remarkable inhibition rate of 96 % against planktonic MRSA, indicating a synergistic activity compared to chitosan nanoparticles or GNR alone. The nanocomposites easily penetrated the biofilm matrix. The combination of chemical and photothermal treatments by NIR-stimulated clusters significantly damaged the biofilm structure, eradicating MRSA inside the biomass. NIR-irradiated chitosan/GNR clusters increased the skin temperature of mice by 13 °C. The plasmonic nanocomposites induced negligible skin irritation in vivo. In summary, this novel nanosystem demonstrated potent antibacterial effects against planktonic and biofilm MRSA, showcasing the possible efficacy in treating skin infections.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642681/,bacterial infection trigger inflammation impede closure skin wound misuse antibiotic exacerbates skin infection generating multidrugresistant bacteria study developed chemophotothermal therapy chemoptt based nearinfrared nirirradiated chitosangold nanorod gnr cluster antimethicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa agent nanocomposites exhibited average size nm surface charge mv plasmonic nanocomposites demonstrated ondemand rapid hyperthermal action nir combined effect positive charge ptt nirirradiated nanocomposites resulted remarkable inhibition rate planktonic mrsa indicating synergistic activity compared chitosan nanoparticles gnr alone nanocomposites easily penetrated biofilm matrix combination chemical photothermal treatment nirstimulated cluster significantly damaged biofilm structure eradicating mrsa inside biomass nirirradiated chitosangnr cluster increased skin temperature mouse c plasmonic nanocomposites induced negligible skin irritation vivo summary novel nanosystem demonstrated potent antibacterial effect planktonic biofilm mrsa showcasing possible efficacy treating skin infection
201,"Exosomes derived from vMIP-II-Lamp2b gene-modified M2 cells provide neuroprotection by targeting the injured spinal cord, inhibiting chemokine signals and modulating microglia/macrophage polarization in mice.","Inflammation is one of the key injury factors for spinal cord injury (SCI). Exosomes (Exos) derived from M2 macrophages have been shown to inhibit inflammation and be beneficial in SCI animal models. However, lacking targetability restricts their application prospects. Considering that chemokine receptors increase dramatically after SCI, viral macrophage inflammatory protein II (vMIP-II) is a broad-spectrum chemokine receptor binding peptide, and lysosomal associated membrane protein 2b (Lamp2b) is the key membrane component of Exos, we speculated that vMIP-II-Lamp2b gene-modified M2 macrophage-derived Exos (vMIP-II-Lamp2b-M2-Exo) not only have anti-inflammatory properties, but also can target the injured area by vMIP-II. In this study, using a murine contusive SCI model, we revealed that vMIP-II-Lamp2b-M2-Exo could target the chemokine receptors which highly expressed in the injured spinal cords, inhibit some key chemokine receptor signaling pathways (such as MAPK and Akt), further inhibit proinflammatory factors (such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, IL-18, TNF-α, and iNOS), and promote anti-inflammatory factors (such as IL-4 and Arg1) productions, and the transformation of microglia/macrophages from M1 into M2. Moreover, the improved histological and functional recoveries were also found. Collectively, our results suggest that vMIP-II-Lamp2b-M2-Exo may provide neuroprotection by targeting the injured spinal cord, inhibiting some chemokine signals, reducing proinflammatory factor production and modulating microglia/macrophage polarization.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642665/,inflammation one key injury factor spinal cord injury sci exosomes exos derived macrophage shown inhibit inflammation beneficial sci animal model however lacking targetability restricts application prospect considering chemokine receptor increase dramatically sci viral macrophage inflammatory protein ii vmipii broadspectrum chemokine receptor binding peptide lysosomal associated membrane protein b lampb key membrane component exos speculated vmipiilampb genemodified macrophagederived exos vmipiilampbmexo antiinflammatory property also target injured area vmipii study using murine contusive sci model revealed vmipiilampbmexo could target chemokine receptor highly expressed injured spinal cord inhibit key chemokine receptor signaling pathway mapk akt inhibit proinflammatory factor il il il il tnf inos promote antiinflammatory factor il arg production transformation microgliamacrophages moreover improved histological functional recovery also found collectively result suggest vmipiilampbmexo may provide neuroprotection targeting injured spinal cord inhibiting chemokine signal reducing proinflammatory factor production modulating microgliamacrophage polarization

203,Single-cell analysis identifies critical regulators of spermatogonial development and differentiation in cattle-yak bulls.,"Spermatogenesis is a continuous process in which functional sperm are produced through a series of mitotic and meiotic divisions and morphological changes in germ cells. The aberrant development and fate transitions of spermatogenic cells cause hybrid sterility in mammals. Cattle-yak, a hybrid animal between taurine cattle (Bos taurus) and yak (Bos grunniens), exhibits male-specific sterility due to spermatogenic failure. In the present study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to identify differences in testicular cell composition and the developmental trajectory of spermatogenic cells between yak and cattle-yak. The composition and molecular signatures of spermatogonial subtypes were dramatically different between these 2 animals, and the expression of genes associated with stem cell maintenance, cell differentiation and meiotic entry was altered in cattle-yak, indicating the impairment of undifferentiated spermatogonial fate decisions. Cell communication analysis revealed that signaling within different spermatogenic cell subpopulations was weakened, and progenitor spermatogonia were unable or delayed receiving and sending signals for transformation to the next stage in cattle-yak. Simultaneously, the communication between niche cells and germ cells was also abnormal. Collectively, we obtained the expression profiles of transcriptome signatures of different germ cells and testicular somatic cell populations at the single-cell level and identified critical regulators of spermatogonial differentiation and meiosis in yak and sterile cattle-yak. The findings of this study shed light on the genetic mechanisms that lead to hybrid sterility and speciation in bovid species.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642661/,spermatogenesis continuous process functional sperm produced series mitotic meiotic division morphological change germ cell aberrant development fate transition spermatogenic cell cause hybrid sterility mammal cattleyak hybrid animal taurine cattle bos taurus yak bos grunniens exhibit malespecific sterility due spermatogenic failure present study performed singlecell rna sequencing analysis identify difference testicular cell composition developmental trajectory spermatogenic cell yak cattleyak composition molecular signature spermatogonial subtypes dramatically different animal expression gene associated stem cell maintenance cell differentiation meiotic entry altered cattleyak indicating impairment undifferentiated spermatogonial fate decision cell communication analysis revealed signaling within different spermatogenic cell subpopulation weakened progenitor spermatogonia unable delayed receiving sending signal transformation next stage cattleyak simultaneously communication niche cell germ cell also abnormal collectively obtained expression profile transcriptome signature different germ cell testicular somatic cell population singlecell level identified critical regulator spermatogonial differentiation meiosis yak sterile cattleyak finding study shed light genetic mechanism lead hybrid sterility speciation bovid specie
204,Endometrial responsiveness to interferon-tau and its association with subsequent reproductive performance in dairy heifers.,"Our objectives were to evaluate the endometrial responsiveness of dairy heifers to an intrauterine infusion of recombinant bovine interferon-tau (rbIFN-τ) and to associate endometrial responses to rbIFN-τ with subsequent reproductive performance. In Experiments 1 and 2, cyclic heifers were enrolled in a 5-d CIDR Cosynch program for estrous synchronization, and blood sampling and ultrasonography examinations were performed on d 0, 4, 7, 11, and 14 of the estrous cycle. In Experiment 1, heifers were randomly assigned to receive an intrauterine infusion containing 2 µg of rbIFN-τ (rbIFN-τ = 19) or saline (CTRL = 19) into the uterine horn ipsilateral to the corpus luteum (CL) on d 14 of the estrous cycle. Six hours after the infusion, the infused uterine horn was flushed for sampling of the uterine luminal fluid (ULF) for analyses of composition, and the endometrium was biopsied for transcriptomics. In Experiment 2, 100 heifers received an intrauterine infusion of rbIFN-τ, and the same procedures for uterine sample collection described in Experiment 1 were performed. After the intrauterine test, heifers were enrolled in a breeding program and classified as highly fertile (HF; pregnant at first AI) or subfertile (SF; not pregnant at first AI). Statistical analyses were performed using linear regression models, which included the effects of treatment (Experiment 1: CTRL vs. rbIFN-τ) or fertility group (Experiment 2: HF vs. SF) and block of samples. Intrauterine infusion of rbIFN-τ increased the expression of classical interferon-stimulated genes in the endometrium (e.g., ISG15, MX1, OAS2, IRF9, and USP18), and an antiviral response was predicted to be the main downstream effect of the transcriptome changes. In addition, rbIFN-τ increased the abundance of cholesterol, glycerol, and the overall concentration of oxylipins in the ULF. Analysis of endometrial transcriptome between HF and SF heifers revealed important differences in the expression of proteins associated with cell signaling, metabolism, attachment, and migration, with a large representation of genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins. In general, differently expressed genes were expected to be downregulated by IFN-τ but seemed to fail to be downregulated in SF heifers, resulting in higher expression in SF compared with HF heifers. Subfertile heifers had lower concentrations of glycerol and an altered profile of oxylipins in the ULF, with lower abundance of oxylipins derived from arachidonic acid and dihomo-γ-linolenic acid, and greater abundance of oxylipins derived from linoleic acid. Measurements of ovarian function did not differ between groups and, therefore, did not influence the observed results in uterine biology. In conclusion, the endometrial responsiveness to IFN-τ is variable among individuals and associated with subsequent fertility of heifers, indicating that communication between conceptus and endometrium is critical for the uterine receptivity and survival of pregnancy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642656/,objective evaluate endometrial responsiveness dairy heifer intrauterine infusion recombinant bovine interferontau rbifn associate endometrial response rbifn subsequent reproductive performance experiment cyclic heifer enrolled cidr cosynch program estrous synchronization blood sampling ultrasonography examination performed estrous cycle experiment heifer randomly assigned receive intrauterine infusion containing g rbifn rbifn saline ctrl uterine horn ipsilateral corpus luteum cl estrous cycle six hour infusion infused uterine horn flushed sampling uterine luminal fluid ulf analysis composition endometrium biopsied transcriptomics experiment heifer received intrauterine infusion rbifn procedure uterine sample collection described experiment performed intrauterine test heifer enrolled breeding program classified highly fertile hf pregnant first ai subfertile sf pregnant first ai statistical analysis performed using linear regression model included effect treatment experiment ctrl v rbifn fertility group experiment hf v sf block sample intrauterine infusion rbifn increased expression classical interferonstimulated gene endometrium eg isg mx oas irf usp antiviral response predicted main downstream effect transcriptome change addition rbifn increased abundance cholesterol glycerol overall concentration oxylipins ulf analysis endometrial transcriptome hf sf heifer revealed important difference expression protein associated cell signaling metabolism attachment migration large representation gene encoding extracellular matrix protein general differently expressed gene expected downregulated ifn seemed fail downregulated sf heifer resulting higher expression sf compared hf heifer subfertile heifer lower concentration glycerol altered profile oxylipins ulf lower abundance oxylipins derived arachidonic acid dihomolinolenic acid greater abundance oxylipins derived linoleic acid measurement ovarian function differ group therefore influence observed result uterine biology conclusion endometrial responsiveness ifn variable among individual associated subsequent fertility heifer indicating communication conceptus endometrium critical uterine receptivity survival pregnancy
205,HH5 Double-Carrier Embryos Fail to Progress through Early Conceptus Elongation.,"Massive genotyping in cattle has uncovered several deleterious haplotypes that cause pre-term mortality. Holstein Haplotype 5 (HH5) is a deleterious haplotype present in the Holstein Friesian population that involves the ablation of the Transcription Factor B1 mitochondrial (TFB1M) gene. The developmental stage at which HH5 double-carrier (DC, homozygous) embryos or fetuses die remains unknown and this is a relevant information to estimate the economic losses associated to the inadvertent cross between carriers. To determine if HH5 DC survive to maternal recognition of pregnancy, embryonic day (E)14 embryos were flushed from superovulated carrier cows inseminated with a carrier bull. DC E14 conceptuses were recovered at Mendelian rates but they failed to achieve early elongation, as evidenced by a drastic (>26-fold) reduction in the proliferation of extraembryonic membranes compared with carrier or non-carrier embryos. To assess development at earlier stages, TFB1M knockout (KO) embryos -functionally equivalent to DC embryos- were generated by CRISPR technology and cultured to the blastocyst stage -Day (D)8- and to the early embryonic disc stage -D12-. No significant effect of TFB1M ablation was observed on the differentiation and proliferation of embryonic lineages and relative mtDNA content up to D12.

206,Harnessing artificial intelligence-driven approach for enhanced indole-3-acetic acid from the newly isolated Streptomyces rutgersensis AW08.,"Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) derived from Actinobacteria fermentations on agro-wastes constitutes a safer and low-cost alternative to synthetic IAA. This study aims to select a high IAA-producing Streptomyces-like strain isolated from Lake Oubeira sediments (El Kala, Algeria) for further investigations (i.e., 16S rRNA gene barcoding and process optimization). Subsequently, artificial intelligence-based approaches were employed to maximize IAA bioproduction on spent coffee grounds as high-value-added feedstock. The specificity was the novel application of the Limited-Memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno Box (L-BFGS-B) optimization algorithm. The new strain AW08 was a significant producer of IAA (26.116 ± 0.61 μg/mL) and was identified as Streptomyces rutgersensis by 16S rRNA gene barcoding and phylogenetic inquiry. The empirical data involved the inoculation of AW08 in various cultural conditions according to a four-factor Box Behnken Design matrix (BBD) of Response surface methodology (RSM). The input parameters and regression equation extracted from the RSM-BBD were the basis for implementing and training the L-BFGS-B algorithm. Upon training the model, the optimal conditions suggested by the BBD and L-BFGS-B algorithm were, respectively, L-Trp (X1) = 0.58 %; 0.57 %; T° (X2) = 26.37 °C; 28.19 °C; pH (X3) = 7.75; 8.59; and carbon source (X4) = 30 %; 33.29 %, with the predicted response IAA (Y) =152.8; 169.18 μg/mL). Our findings emphasize the potential of the multifunctional S. rutgersensis AW08, isolated and reported for the first time in Algeria, as a robust producer of IAA. Validation investigations using the bioprocess parameters provided by the L-BFGS-B and the BBD-RSM models demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-driven optimization in maximizing IAA output by 5.43-fold and 4.2-fold, respectively. This study constitutes the first paper reporting a novel interdisciplinary approach and providing insights into biotechnological advancements.

207,The nucleolus: Coordinating stress response and genomic stability.,"The perception that the nucleoli are merely the organelles where ribosome biogenesis occurs is challenged. Only around 30 % of nucleolar proteins are solely involved in producing ribosomes. Instead, the nucleolus plays a critical role in controlling protein trafficking during stress and, according to its dynamic nature, undergoes continuous protein exchange with nucleoplasm under various cellular stressors. Hence, the concept of nucleolar stress has evolved as cellular insults that disrupt the structure and function of the nucleolus. Considering the emerging role of this organelle in DNA repair and the fact that rDNAs are the most fragile genomic loci, therapies targeting the nucleoli are increasingly being developed. Besides, drugs that target ribosome synthesis and induce nucleolar stress can be used in cancer therapy. In contrast, agents that regulate nucleolar activity may be a potential treatment for neurodegeneration caused by abnormal protein accumulation in the nucleolus.

210,Polymorphisms in the cysteine dioxygenase gene and their association with taurine content in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas.,"The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is rich in taurine, which is crucial for its adaptation to the fluctuating intertidal environment and presents significant potential in improving taurine nutrition and boosting immunity in humans. Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) is a key enzyme involved in the initial step of taurine biosynthesis and plays a crucial role in regulating taurine content in the body. In the present study, polymorphisms of CDO gene in C. gigas (CgCDO) and their association with taurine content were evaluated in 198 individuals. A total of 24 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci were identified in the exonic region of the CgCDO gene by direct sequencing. Among these SNPs, c.279G > A and c.287C > A were found to be significantly associated with taurine content, with the GG and AA genotype at the two loci exhibiting enhanced taurine accumulation (p < 0.05). Haplotype analysis revealed that the 279GG/287AA haplotype had the highest taurine content of 29.24 mg/g, while the 279AA/287CC haplotype showed the lowest taurine content of 21.19 mg/g.

211,Network model of skeletal muscle cell signalling predicts differential responses to endurance and resistance exercise training.,"Exercise-induced muscle adaptations vary based on exercise modality and intensity. We constructed a signalling network model from 87 published studies of human or rodent skeletal muscle cell responses to endurance or resistance exercise in vivo or simulated exercise in vitro. The network comprises 259 signalling interactions between 120 nodes, representing eight membrane receptors and eight canonical signalling pathways regulating 14 transcriptional regulators, 28 target genes and 12 exercise-induced phenotypes. Using this network, we formulated a logic-based ordinary differential equation model predicting time-dependent molecular and phenotypic alterations following acute endurance and resistance exercises. Compared with nine independent studies, the model accurately predicted 18/21 (85%) acute responses to resistance exercise and 12/16 (75%) acute responses to endurance exercise. Detailed sensitivity analysis of differential phenotypic responses to resistance and endurance training showed that, in the model, exercise regulates cell growth and protein synthesis primarily by signalling via mechanistic target of rapamycin, which is activated by Akt and inhibited in endurance exercise by AMP-activated protein kinase. Endurance exercise preferentially activates inflammation via reactive oxygen species and nuclear factor κB signalling. Furthermore, the expected preferential activation of mitochondrial biogenesis by endurance exercise was counterbalanced in the model by protein kinase C in response to resistance training. This model provides a new tool for investigating cross-talk between skeletal muscle signalling pathways activated by endurance and resistance exercise, and the mechanisms of interactions such as the interference effects of endurance training on resistance exercise outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643471/,exerciseinduced muscle adaptation vary based exercise modality intensity constructed signalling network model published study human rodent skeletal muscle cell response endurance resistance exercise vivo simulated exercise vitro network comprises signalling interaction node representing eight membrane receptor eight canonical signalling pathway regulating transcriptional regulator target gene exerciseinduced phenotype using network formulated logicbased ordinary differential equation model predicting timedependent molecular phenotypic alteration following acute endurance resistance exercise compared nine independent study model accurately predicted acute response resistance exercise acute response endurance exercise detailed sensitivity analysis differential phenotypic response resistance endurance training showed model exercise regulates cell growth protein synthesis primarily signalling via mechanistic target rapamycin activated akt inhibited endurance exercise ampactivated protein kinase endurance exercise preferentially activates inflammation via reactive oxygen specie nuclear factor b signalling furthermore expected preferential activation mitochondrial biogenesis endurance exercise counterbalanced model protein kinase c response resistance training model provides new tool investigating crosstalk skeletal muscle signalling pathway activated endurance resistance exercise mechanism interaction interference effect endurance training resistance exercise outcome

216,Improving the production of carbamoyltobramycin by an industrial Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius through metabolic engineering.,"Tobramycin is an essential and extensively used broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic obtained through alkaline hydrolysis of carbamoyltobramycin, one of the fermentation products of Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius. To simplify the composition of fermentation products from industrial strain, the main byproduct apramycin was blocked by gene disruption and constructed a mutant mainly producing carbamoyltobramycin. The generation of antibiotics is significantly affected by the secondary metabolism of actinomycetes which could be controlled by modifying the pathway-specific regulatory proteins within the cluster. Within the tobramycin biosynthesis cluster, a transcriptional regulatory factor TobR belonging to the Lrp/AsnC family was identified. Based on the sequence and structural characteristics, tobR might encode a pathway-specific transcriptional regulatory factor during biosynthesis. Knockout and overexpression strains of tobR were constructed to investigate its role in carbamoyltobramycin production. Results showed that knockout of TobR increased carbamoyltobramycin biosynthesis by 22.35%, whereas its overexpression decreased carbamoyltobramycin production by 10.23%. In vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments confirmed that TobR interacts with DNA at the adjacent tobO promoter position. Strains overexpressing tobO with ermEp* promoter exhibited 36.36% increase, and tobO with kasOp* promoter exhibited 22.84% increase in carbamoyltobramycin titer. When the overexpressing of tobO and the knockout of tobR were combined, the production of carbamoyltobramycin was further enhanced. In the shake-flask fermentation, the titer reached 3.76 g/L, which was 42.42% higher than that of starting strain. Understanding the role of Lrp/AsnC family transcription regulators would be useful for other antibiotic biosynthesis in other actinomycetes.

217,"Kurarinone, a flavonoid from Radix Sophorae Flavescentis, inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in mouse bone marrow-derived monocyte/macrophages.","Inflammation-induced osteoclast proliferation is a crucial contributor to impaired bone metabolism. Kurarinone (KR), a flavonoid extracted from the Radix Sophorae Flavescentis, exhibits notable anti-inflammatory properties. Nevertheless, the precise influence of KR on osteoclast formation remains unclear. This study's objective was to assess the impact of KR on osteoclast activity in vitro and unravel its underlying mechanism. Initially, a target network for KR-osteoclastogenesis-osteoporosis was constructed using network pharmacology. Subsequently, the intersecting targets were identified through the Venny platform and a PPI network was created using Cytoscape 3.9.1. Key targets within the network were identified employing topological algorithms. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis were then performed on these targets to explore their specific functions and pathways. Additionally, molecular docking of potential core targets of KR was conducted, and the results were validated through cell experiments. A total of 83 target genes overlapped between KR and osteoclastogenesis-osteoporosis targets. Enrichment analysis revealed their role in inflammatory response, protein tyrosine kinase activity, osteoclast differentiation, and MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. PPI analysis and molecular docking demonstrate that key targets MAPK14 and MAPK8 exhibit more stable binding with KR compared to other proteins. In vitro experiments demonstrate that KR effectively inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption without cellular toxicity. It suppresses key osteoclast genes (NFATc1, c-Fos, TRAP, MMP9, Ctsk, Atp6v2), hinders IκB-α degradation, and inhibits ERK and JNK phosphorylation, while not affecting p38 phosphorylation. The results indicate that KR may inhibit osteoclast maturation and bone resorption by blocking NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways, suggesting its potential as a natural therapeutic agent for osteoporosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643449/,inflammationinduced osteoclast proliferation crucial contributor impaired bone metabolism kurarinone kr flavonoid extracted radix sophorae flavescentis exhibit notable antiinflammatory property nevertheless precise influence kr osteoclast formation remains unclear study objective ass impact kr osteoclast activity vitro unravel underlying mechanism initially target network krosteoclastogenesisosteoporosis constructed using network pharmacology subsequently intersecting target identified venny platform ppi network created using cytoscape key target within network identified employing topological algorithm go enrichment kegg pathway analysis performed target explore specific function pathway additionally molecular docking potential core target kr conducted result validated cell experiment total target gene overlapped kr osteoclastogenesisosteoporosis target enrichment analysis revealed role inflammatory response protein tyrosine kinase activity osteoclast differentiation mapk nfb signaling pathway ppi analysis molecular docking demonstrate key target mapk mapk exhibit stable binding kr compared protein vitro experiment demonstrate kr effectively inhibits osteoclast differentiation bone resorption without cellular toxicity suppresses key osteoclast gene nfatc cfo trap mmp ctsk atpv hinders ib degradation inhibits erk jnk phosphorylation affecting p phosphorylation result indicate kr may inhibit osteoclast maturation bone resorption blocking nfb mapk signaling pathway suggesting potential natural therapeutic agent osteoporosis
218,Adipose-derived stem cells promote glycolysis and peritoneal metastasis via TGF-β1/SMAD3/ANGPTL4 axis in colorectal cancer.,"Peritoneal metastasis, the third most common metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC), has a poor prognosis for the rapid progression and limited therapeutic strategy. However, the molecular characteristics and pathogenesis of CRC peritoneal metastasis are poorly understood. Here, we aimed to elucidate the action and mechanism of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), a prominent component of the peritoneal microenvironment, in CRC peritoneal metastasis formation. Database analysis indicated that ADSCs infiltration was increased in CRC peritoneal metastases, and high expression levels of ADSCs marker genes predicted a poor prognosis. Then we investigated the effect of ADSCs on CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. The results revealed that CRC cells co-cultured with ADSCs exhibited stronger metastatic property and anoikis resistance, and ADSCs boosted the intraperitoneal seeding of CRC cells. Furthermore, RNA sequencing was carried out to identify the key target gene, angiopoietin like 4 (ANGPTL4), which was upregulated in CRC specimens, especially in peritoneal metastases. Mechanistically, TGF-β1 secreted by ADSCs activated SMAD3 in CRC cells, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that SMAD3 facilitated ANGPTL4 transcription by directly binding to ANGPTL4 promoter. The ANGPTL4 upregulation was essential for ADSCs to promote glycolysis and anoikis resistance in CRC. Importantly, simultaneously targeting TGF-β signaling and ANGPTL4 efficiently reduced intraperitoneal seeding in vivo. In conclusion, this study indicates that tumor-infiltrating ADSCs promote glycolysis and anoikis resistance in CRC cells and ultimately facilitate peritoneal metastasis via the TGF-β1/SMAD3/ANGPTL4 axis. The dual-targeting of TGF-β signaling and ANGPTL4 may be a feasible therapeutic strategy for CRC peritoneal metastasis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643448/,peritoneal metastasis third common metastasis colorectal cancer crc poor prognosis rapid progression limited therapeutic strategy however molecular characteristic pathogenesis crc peritoneal metastasis poorly understood aimed elucidate action mechanism adiposederived stem cell adscs prominent component peritoneal microenvironment crc peritoneal metastasis formation database analysis indicated adscs infiltration increased crc peritoneal metastasis high expression level adscs marker gene predicted poor prognosis investigated effect adscs crc cell vitro vivo result revealed crc cell cocultured adscs exhibited stronger metastatic property anoikis resistance adscs boosted intraperitoneal seeding crc cell furthermore rna sequencing carried identify key target gene angiopoietin like angptl upregulated crc specimen especially peritoneal metastasis mechanistically tgf secreted adscs activated smad crc cell chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed smad facilitated angptl transcription directly binding angptl promoter angptl upregulation essential adscs promote glycolysis anoikis resistance crc importantly simultaneously targeting tgf signaling angptl efficiently reduced intraperitoneal seeding vivo conclusion study indicates tumorinfiltrating adscs promote glycolysis anoikis resistance crc cell ultimately facilitate peritoneal metastasis via tgfsmadangptl axis dualtargeting tgf signaling angptl may feasible therapeutic strategy crc peritoneal metastasis

Post-fertilization eggs were exposed to increasing concentrations of the drugs for six days. The expression levels of two genetic biomarkers for toxicity and four thyroid hormone-related gene pathways were measured. Interestingly, the results showed that all concentrations of the five cytostatics affect the transcription levels of both toxicity biomarker genes. Additionally, the thyroid hormone-related genes had different expression levels than the control, with the most significant changes observed in those larvae exposed to cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide.

222,Absence of E2f1 Negates Pro-osteogenic Impacts of p21 Absence.,"Loss of p21 leads to increased bone formation post-injury; however, the mechanism(s) by which this occurs remains undetermined. E2f1 is downstream of p21 and as a transcription factor can act directly on gene expression; yet it is unknown if E2f1 plays a role in the osteogenic effects observed when p21 is differentially regulated. In this study we aimed to investigate the interplay between p21 and E2f1 and determine if the pro-regenerative osteogenic effects observed with the loss of p21 are E2f1 dependent. To accomplish this, we employed knockout p21 and E2f1 mice and additionally generated a p21/E2f1 double knockout. These mice underwent burr-hole injuries to their proximal tibiae and healing was assessed over 7 days via microCT imaging. We found that p21 and E2f1 play distinct roles in bone regeneration where the loss of p21 increased trabecular bone formation and loss of E2f1 increased cortical bone formation, yet loss of E2f1 led to poorer bone repair overall. Furthermore, when E2f1 was absent, either individually or simultaneously with p21, there was a dramatic decrease of the number of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and chondrocytes at the site of injury compared to p21",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643416/,loss p lead increased bone formation postinjury however mechanism occurs remains undetermined ef downstream p transcription factor act directly gene expression yet unknown ef play role osteogenic effect observed p differentially regulated study aimed investigate interplay p ef determine proregenerative osteogenic effect observed loss p ef dependent accomplish employed knockout p ef mouse additionally generated pef double knockout mouse underwent burrhole injury proximal tibia healing assessed day via microct imaging found p ef play distinct role bone regeneration loss p increased trabecular bone formation loss ef increased cortical bone formation yet loss ef led poorer bone repair overall furthermore ef absent either individually simultaneously p dramatic decrease number osteoblast osteoclast chondrocytes site injury compared p

226,Navigating therapeutic strategies: HPV classification in head and neck cancer.,"The World Health Organisation recognised human papillomavirus (HPV) as the cause of multiple cancers, including head and neck cancers. HPV is a double-stranded DNA virus, and its viral gene expression can be controlled after infection by cellular and viral promoters. In cancer cells, the HPV genome is detected as either integrated into the host genome, episomal (extrachromosomal), or a mixture of integrated and episomal. Viral integration requires the breakage of both viral and host DNA, and the integration rate correlates with the level of DNA damage. Interestingly, patients with HPV-positive head and neck cancers generally have a good prognosis except for a group of patients with fully integrated HPV who show worst clinical outcomes. Those patients present with lowered expression of viral genes and limited infiltration of cytotoxic T cells. An impediment to effective therapy applications in the clinic is the sole testing for HPV positivity without considering the HPV integration status.

227,Peanut LEAFY COTYLEDON1-type genes participate in regulating the embryo development and the accumulation of storage lipids.,"Two peanut LEC1-type genes exhibit partial functional redundancy. AhNFYB10 could complement almost all the defective phenotypes of lec1-2 in terms of embryonic morphology, while AhNF-YB1 could partially affect these phenotypes. LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) is a member of the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) family of transcription factors and has been identified as a key regulator of embryonic development. In the present study, two LEC1-type genes from Arachis hypogeae were identified and designated as AhNF-YB1 and AhNF-YB10; these genes belong to subgenome A and subgenome B, respectively. The functions of AhNF-YB1 and AhNF-YB10 were investigated by complementation analysis of their defective phenotypes of the Arabidopsis lec1-2 mutant and by ectopic expression in wild-type Arabidopsis. The results indicated that both AhNF-YB1 and AhNF-YB10 participate in regulating embryogenesis, embryo development, and reserve deposition in cotyledons and that they have partial functional redundancy. In contrast, AhNF-YB10 complemented almost all the defective phenotypes of lec1-2 in terms of embryonic morphology and hypocotyl length, while AhNF-YB1 had only a partial effect. In addition, 30-40% of the seeds of the AhNF-YB1 transformants exhibited a decreasing germination ratio and longevity. Therefore, appropriate spatiotemporal expression of these genes is necessary for embryo morphogenesis at the early development stage and is responsible for seed maturation at the mid-late development stage. On the other hand, overexpression of AhNF-YB1 or AhNF-YB10 at the middle to late stages of Arabidopsis seed development improved the weight, oil content, and fatty acid composition of the transgenic seeds. Moreover, the expression levels of several genes associated with fatty acid synthesis and embryogenesis were significantly greater in developing AhNF-YB10-overexpressing seeds than in control seeds.

228,Haemostatic gene variations in cervical cancer-associated venous thrombosis: considerations for clinical strategies.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a life-threatening haemostatic disease frequently diagnosed among the cancer population. The Khorana Score is currently the primal risk assessment model to stratify oncological patients according to their susceptibility to VTE, however, it displays a limited performance. Meanwhile, intensive research on VTE pathophysiology in the general population has uncovered a range of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the condition. Nonetheless, their predictive ability concerning cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) is controversial. Cervical cancer (CC) patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy often experience VTE, which negatively affects their survival. Thus, aiming for an improvement in thromboprophylaxis, new thrombotic biomarkers, including SNPs, are currently under investigation. In this study, the predictive capability of haemostatic gene SNPs on CC-related VTE and their prognostic value regardless of VTE were explored. Six SNPs in haemostatic genes were evaluated. A total of 401 CC patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy were enrolled in a retrospective cohort study. The implications for the time to VTE occurrence and overall survival (OS) were assessed. CAT considerably impacted the CC patients' OS (log-rank test, P < 0.001). SERPINE1 rs2070682 (T > C) showed a significant association with the risk of CC-related VTE (CC/CT vs. TT, log-rank test, P = 0.002; C allele, Cox model, hazard ratio (HR) = 6.99 and P = 0.009), while F2 rs1799963 (G > A) demonstrated an important prognostic value regardless of VTE (AA/AG vs. GG, log-rank test, P = 0.020; A allele, Cox model, HR = 2.76 and P = 0.026). For the remaining SNPs, no significant associations were detected.

231,8-Cl-Ado and 8-NH,"Targeting the metabolic dependencies of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells is a promising therapeutical strategy. In particular, the cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway (C/M) is significantly altered in AML cells compared to healthy blood cells. Moreover, methionine has been identified as one of the dominant amino acid dependencies of AML cells. Through RNA-seq, we found that the two nucleoside analogs 8-chloro-adenosine (8CA) and 8-amino-adenosine (8AA) significantly suppress the C/M pathway in AML cells, and methionine-adenosyltransferase-2A (MAT2A) is one of most significantly downregulated genes. Additionally, mass spectrometry analysis revealed that Venetoclax (VEN), a BCL-2 inhibitor recently approved by the FDA for AML treatment, significantly decreases the intracellular level of methionine in AML cells. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that combining 8CA or 8AA with VEN can efficiently target the Methionine-MAT2A-S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) axis in AML. Our results demonstrate that VEN and 8CA/8AA synergistically decrease the SAM biosynthesis and effectively target AML cells both in vivo and in vitro. These findings suggest the promising potential of combining 8CA/8AA and VEN for AML treatment by inhibiting Methionine-MAT2A-SAM axis and provide a strong rationale for our recently activated clinical trial.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643304/,targeting metabolic dependency acute myeloid leukemia aml cell promising therapeutical strategy particular cysteine methionine metabolism pathway cm significantly altered aml cell compared healthy blood cell moreover methionine identified one dominant amino acid dependency aml cell rnaseq found two nucleoside analog chloroadenosine ca aminoadenosine aa significantly suppress cm pathway aml cell methionineadenosyltransferasea mata one significantly downregulated gene additionally mass spectrometry analysis revealed venetoclax ven bcl inhibitor recently approved fda aml treatment significantly decrease intracellular level methionine aml cell based finding hypothesized combining ca aa ven efficiently target methioninematasadenosylmethionine sam axis aml result demonstrate ven caaa synergistically decrease sam biosynthesis effectively target aml cell vivo vitro finding suggest promising potential combining caaa ven aml treatment inhibiting methioninematasam axis provide strong rationale recently activated clinical trial
232,NET-related gene signature for predicting AML prognosis.,"Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a malignant blood cancer with a high mortality rate. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) influence various tumor outcomes. However, NET-related genes (NRGs) in AML had not yet received much attention. This study focuses on the role of NRGs in AML and their interaction with the immunological microenvironment. The gene expression and clinical data of patients with AML were downloaded from the TCGA-LAML and GEO cohorts. We identified 148 NRGs through the published article. Univariate Cox regression was used to analyze the association of NRGs with overall survival (OS). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were utilized to assess the predictive efficacy of NRGs. Kaplan-Meier plots visualized survival estimates. ROC curves assessed the prognostic value of NRG-based features. A nomogram, integrating clinical information and prognostic scores of patients, was constructed using multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression models. Twenty-seven NRGs were found to significantly impact patient OS. Six NRGs-CFTR, ENO1, PARVB, DDIT4, MPO, LDLR-were notable for their strong predictive ability regarding patient survival. The ROC values for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 0.794, 0.781, and 0.911, respectively. In the training set (TCGA-LAML), patients in the high NRG risk group showed a poorer prognosis (p < 0.001), which was validated in two external datasets (GSE71014 and GSE106291). The 6-NRG signature and corresponding nomograms exhibit superior predictive accuracy, offering insights for pre-immune response evaluation and guiding future immuno-oncology treatments and drug selection for AML patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643300/,acute myeloid leukemia aml malignant blood cancer high mortality rate neutrophil extracellular trap net influence various tumor outcome however netrelated gene nrgs aml yet received much attention study focus role nrgs aml interaction immunological microenvironment gene expression clinical data patient aml downloaded tcgalaml geo cohort identified nrgs published article univariate cox regression used analyze association nrgs overall survival o least absolute shrinkage selection operator utilized ass predictive efficacy nrgs kaplanmeier plot visualized survival estimate roc curve assessed prognostic value nrgbased feature nomogram integrating clinical information prognostic score patient constructed using multivariate logistic regression cox proportional hazard regression model twentyseven nrgs found significantly impact patient o six nrgscftr eno parvb ddit mpo ldlrwere notable strong predictive ability regarding patient survival roc value year survival rate respectively training set tcgalaml patient high nrg risk group showed poorer prognosis p validated two external datasets gse gse nrg signature corresponding nomogram exhibit superior predictive accuracy offering insight preimmune response evaluation guiding future immunooncology treatment drug selection aml patient

S. tropicum is a high temperature preferring species thriving in tropical ocean regions or temperate ocean regions during summer-autumn. However, mechanisms of ecological adaptation of S. tropicum remain poorly understood due partially to the lack of a high-quality whole genome assembly. Here, we report the first high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly for S. tropicum, using cutting-edge technologies including PacBio single molecular sequencing and high-throughput chromatin conformation capture. The assembled genome has a size of 78.78 Mb with a scaffold N50 of 3.17 Mb, anchored to 23 pseudo-chromosomes. In total, 20,613 protein-coding genes were predicted, of which 17,757 (86.14%) genes were functionally annotated.

235,Spontaneous Akt2 deficiency in a colony of NOD mice exhibiting early diabetes.,"Diabetes constitutes a major public health problem, with dramatic consequences for patients. Both genetic and environmental factors were shown to contribute to the different forms of the disease. The monogenic forms, found both in humans and in animal models, specially help to decipher the role of key genes in the physiopathology of the disease. Here, we describe the phenotype of early diabetes in a colony of NOD mice, with spontaneous invalidation of Akt2, that we called HYP. The HYP mice were characterised by a strong and chronic hyperglycaemia, beginning around the age of one month, especially in male mice. The phenotype was not the consequence of the acceleration of the autoimmune response, inherent to the NOD background. Interestingly, in HYP mice, we observed hyperinsulinemia before hyperglycaemia occurred. We did not find any difference in the pancreas' architecture of the NOD and HYP mice (islets' size and staining for insulin and glucagon) but we detected a lower insulin content in the pancreas of HYP mice compared to NOD mice. These results give new insights about the role played by Akt2 in glucose homeostasis and argue for the ß cell failure being the primary event in the course of diabetes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643275/,diabetes constitutes major public health problem dramatic consequence patient genetic environmental factor shown contribute different form disease monogenic form found human animal model specially help decipher role key gene physiopathology disease describe phenotype early diabetes colony nod mouse spontaneous invalidation akt called hyp hyp mouse characterised strong chronic hyperglycaemia beginning around age one month especially male mouse phenotype consequence acceleration autoimmune response inherent nod background interestingly hyp mouse observed hyperinsulinemia hyperglycaemia occurred find difference pancreas architecture nod hyp mouse islet size staining insulin glucagon detected lower insulin content pancreas hyp mouse compared nod mouse result give new insight role played akt glucose homeostasis argue cell failure primary event course diabetes
236,Integrative analysis in head and neck cancer reveals distinct role of miRNome and methylome as tumour epigenetic drivers.,"Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide, with the relatively low 5-year survival rate, mainly because it is diagnosed at a late stage. Infection with HPV is a well known aetiology, which affects the nature of these cancers and patients' survival. Besides, it is considered that the main driving force for this type of cancer could be epigenetics. In this study we aimed to find potential epigenetic biomarkers, by integrating miRNome, methylome, and transcriptome analyses. From the fresh head and neck cancer tissue samples, we chose a group for miRNome, methylome and transcriptome profiling, in comparison to adequate control samples. Bioinformatics analyses are performed in R v4.2.2. Count normalisation and group differential expression for mRNA and the previously obtained miRNA count data was performed with DESeq2 v1.36. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed and visualised using gProfiler2 v0.2.1 Identification of miRNA targets was performed by querying in miRTarBase using multiMiR v1.18.0. Annotation of CpG sites merging into islands was obtained from RnBeads.hg19 v1.28.0. package. For the integrative analysis we performed kmeans clustering using stats v4.2.2 package, using 8-12 clusters and nstart 100. We found that transcriptome analysis divides samples into cancers and controls clusters, with no relation to HPV status or cancer anatomical location. Differentially expressed genes (n = 2781) were predominantly associated with signalling pathways of tumour progression. We identified a cluster of genes under the control of the transcription factor E2F that are significantly underexpressed in cancer tissue, as well as T cell immunity genes and genes related to regulation of transcription. Among overexpressed genes in tumours we found those that belong to cell cycle regulation and vasculature. A small number of genes were found significantly differentially expressed in HPV-positive versus HPV-negative tumours (for example NEFH, ZFR2, TAF7L, ZNF541, and TYMS). In this comprehensive study on an overlapping set of samples where the integration of miRNome, methylome and transcriptome analysis were performed for head and neck cancer, we demonstrated that the majority of genes were associated exclusively with miRNome or methylome and, to a lesser extent, under the control of both epigenetic mechanisms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643268/,head neck cancer sixth common malignancy worldwide relatively low year survival rate mainly diagnosed late stage infection hpv well known aetiology affect nature cancer patient survival besides considered main driving force type cancer could epigenetics study aimed find potential epigenetic biomarkers integrating mirnome methylome transcriptome analysis fresh head neck cancer tissue sample chose group mirnome methylome transcriptome profiling comparison adequate control sample bioinformatics analysis performed r v count normalisation group differential expression mrna previously obtained mirna count data performed deseq v gene set enrichment analysis performed visualised using gprofiler v identification mirna target performed querying mirtarbase using multimir v annotation cpg site merging island obtained rnbeadshg v package integrative analysis performed kmeans clustering using stats v package using cluster nstart found transcriptome analysis divide sample cancer control cluster relation hpv status cancer anatomical location differentially expressed gene n predominantly associated signalling pathway tumour progression identified cluster gene control transcription factor ef significantly underexpressed cancer tissue well cell immunity gene gene related regulation transcription among overexpressed gene tumour found belong cell cycle regulation vasculature small number gene found significantly differentially expressed hpvpositive versus hpvnegative tumour example nefh zfr tafl znf tyms comprehensive study overlapping set sample integration mirnome methylome transcriptome analysis performed head neck cancer demonstrated majority gene associated exclusively mirnome methylome lesser extent control epigenetic mechanism

239,Alfalfa xeno-miR159a regulates bovine mammary epithelial cell proliferation and milk protein synthesis by targeting PTPRF.,"Milk protein content is an important index to evaluate the quality and nutrition of milk. Accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in bovine lactation, but little is known regarding the cross-kingdom regulatory roles of plant-derived exogenous miRNAs (xeno-miRNAs) in milk protein synthesis, particularly the underlying molecular mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to explore the regulatory mechanism of alfalfa-derived xeno-miRNAs on proliferation and milk protein synthesis in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs). Our previous study showed that alfalfa miR159a (mtr-miR159a, xeno-miR159a) was highly expressed in alfalfa, and the abundance of mtr-miR159a was significantly lower in serum and whey from high-protein-milk dairy cows compared with low-protein-milk dairy cows. In this study, mRNA expression was detected by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), and casein content was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected using the cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining, western blot, and flow cytometry. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to determine the regulation of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type F (PTPRF) by xeno-miR159a. We found that xeno-miR159a overexpression inhibited proliferation of BMEC and promoted cell apoptosis. Besides, xeno-miR159a overexpression decreased β-casein abundance, and increased α-casein and κ-casein abundance in BMECs. Dual-luciferase reporter assay result confirmed that PTPRF is a target gene of xeno-miR159a.

240,Detection and genomic characterization of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli harboring tet(X4) in black kites (Milvus migrans) in Pakistan.,"The emergence of plasmid-mediated tigecycline resistance gene tet(X4) among clinically relevant bacteria has promoted significant concerns, as tigecycline is considered a last-resort drug against serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. We herein focused on the isolation and molecular characterization of tet(X4)-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) in wild bird populations with anthropogenic interaction in Faisalabad, Pakistan. A total of 150 birds including black kites (Milvus migrans) and house crows (Corvus splendens) were screened for the presence of tigecycline resistance K. pneumoniae and E. coli. We found two K. pneumoniae and one E. coli isolate carrying tet(X4) originating from black kites. A combination of short- and long-read sequencing strategies showed that tet(X4) was located on a broad host range IncFII plasmid family in K. pneumoniae isolates whereas on an IncFII-IncFIB hybrid plasmid in E. coli. We also found an integrative and conjugative element ICEKp2 in K. pneumoniae isolate KP8336. We demonstrate the first description of tet(X4) gene in the WHO critical-priority pathogen K. pneumoniae among wild birds. The convergence of tet(X4) and virulence associated ICEKp2 in a wild bird with known anthropogenic contact should be further investigated to evaluate the potential epidemiological implications. The potential risk of global transmission of tet(X4)-positive K. pneumoniae and E. coli warrant comprehensive evaluation and emphasizes the need for effective mitigation strategies to reduce anthropogenic-driven dissemination of AMR in the environment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643223/,emergence plasmidmediated tigecycline resistance gene tetx among clinically relevant bacteria promoted significant concern tigecycline considered lastresort drug serious infection caused multidrugresistant bacteria herein focused isolation molecular characterization tetxpositive klebsiella pneumoniae k pneumoniae escherichia coli e coli wild bird population anthropogenic interaction faisalabad pakistan total bird including black kite milvus migrans house crow corvus splendens screened presence tigecycline resistance k pneumoniae e coli found two k pneumoniae one e coli isolate carrying tetx originating black kite combination short longread sequencing strategy showed tetx located broad host range incfii plasmid family k pneumoniae isolates whereas incfiiincfib hybrid plasmid e coli also found integrative conjugative element icekp k pneumoniae isolate kp demonstrate first description tetx gene criticalpriority pathogen k pneumoniae among wild bird convergence tetx virulence associated icekp wild bird known anthropogenic contact investigated evaluate potential epidemiological implication potential risk global transmission tetxpositive k pneumoniae e coli warrant comprehensive evaluation emphasizes need effective mitigation strategy reduce anthropogenicdriven dissemination amr environment

242,"The overlooked evolutionary dynamics of 16S rRNA revises its role as the ""gold standard"" for bacterial species identification.","The role of 16S rRNA has been and largely remains crucial for the identification of microbial organisms. Although 16S rRNA could certainly be described as one of the most studied sequences ever, the current view of it remains somewhat ambiguous. While some consider 16S rRNA to be a variable marker with resolution power down to the strain level, others consider them to be living fossils that carry information about the origin of domains of cellular life. We show that 16S rRNA is clearly an evolutionarily very rigid sequence, making it a largely unique and irreplaceable marker, but its applicability beyond the genus level is highly limited. Interestingly, it seems that the evolutionary rigidity is not driven by functional constraints of the sequence (RNA-protein interactions), but rather results from the characteristics of the host organism. Our results suggest that, at least in some lineages, Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) within genera plays an important role for the evolutionary non-dynamics (stasis) of 16S rRNA. Such genera exhibit an apparent lack of diversification at the 16S rRNA level in comparison to the rest of a genome.

Mucosal biopsies of the descending duodenum were collected. Five regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified and sequenced. Other assessments conducted on the study subjects included body mass index, transient elastography, liver enzymes, and lipid profile. Fifty-one subjects (36 with MASLD and 15 controls) were evaluated. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding alpha- or beta-diversity of the duodenal mucosal microbiota. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis showed that the genera Serratia and Aggregatibacter were more abundant in the duodenal mucosa of patients with MASLD, whereas the duodenal mucosal microbiota of the healthy controls was enriched with the genus Petrobacter. PICRUSt2 analysis revealed that genes associated with amino acid degradation and carboxylate degradation were significantly enriched in the duodenal mucosal microbiota of patients with MASLD.

However, little attention has been paid to the functional roles of the involved secretory pathway in the high-level production of cellulases in T. reesei. Rab GTPases are key regulators in coordinating various vesicle trafficking associated with the eukaryotic secretory pathway. Specifically, Rab7 is a representative GTPase regulating the transition of the early endosome to the late endosome followed by its fusion to the vacuole as well as homotypic vacuole fusion.

247,N4BP1 functions as a dimerization-dependent linear ubiquitin reader which regulates TNF signalling.,"Signalling through TNFR1 modulates proinflammatory gene transcription and programmed cell death, and its impairment causes autoimmune diseases and cancer. NEDD4-binding protein 1 (N4BP1) is a critical suppressor of proinflammatory cytokine production that acts as a regulator of innate immune signalling and inflammation. However, our current understanding about the molecular properties that enable N4BP1 to exert its suppressive potential remain limited. Here, we show that N4BP1 is a novel linear ubiquitin reader that negatively regulates NFκB signalling by its unique dimerization-dependent ubiquitin-binding module that we named LUBIN. Dimeric N4BP1 strategically positions two non-selective ubiquitin-binding domains to ensure preferential recognition of linear ubiquitin. Under proinflammatory conditions, N4BP1 is recruited to the nascent TNFR1 signalling complex, where it regulates duration of proinflammatory signalling in LUBIN-dependent manner. N4BP1 deficiency accelerates TNFα-induced cell death by increasing complex II assembly.

Here, we identify 7 families presenting a new cardiac entity associated with a heterozygous deletion of 2 CTCF binding sites on 4q25, inducing TAD fusion and chromatin conformation remodeling. The CTCF binding sites are located in a gene desert at 1 Mb from the Paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 gene (PITX2). By introducing the ortholog of the human deletion in the mouse genome, we recapitulate the patient phenotype and characterize an opposite dysregulation of PITX2 expression in the sinoatrial node (ectopic activation) and ventricle (reduction), respectively. Chromatin conformation assay performed in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes harboring the minimal deletion identified in family#1 reveals a conformation remodeling and fusion of TADs.

256,A novel variant in NSUN2 causes intellectual disability in a Chinese family.,"NSUN2-intellectual disability syndrome, also known as intellectual disability type 5 (MRT5), is an autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by intellectual disability (ID), postnatal growth retardation, dysmorphic facies, microcephaly, short stature, developmental delay, language impairment and other congenital abnormalities. The disease is caused by mutations in the NSUN2 gene, which encodes a tRNA cytosine methyltransferase that has an important role in spindle assembly during mitosis and chromosome segregation. In this study, we recruited a family that had two individuals with ID. Whole exome sequencing was performed to identify a homozygous frameshift variant (c.1171_1175delACCAT(p.Thr391fs*18*)) in NSUN2 (NM_017755.5) in the proband. The varint was confirmed as segregating in his affected brother and his parents by Sanger sequencing. The individuals that we described showed a similar dysmorphology profile to that associated with MRT5. To analyze the correlations between genotypes of NSUN2 and phenotypes of individuals with ID, we examined 17 variants and the associated phenotypes from 32 ID individuals in current and previous studies. We concluded that mutations in NSUN2 cause a wide range of phenotypic defects. Although some clinical manifestations were highly variable, the core phenotypes associated with NSUN2 mutations were dysmorphic facies, microcephaly, short stature, ID, growth restriction, language impairment, hypotonia and delayed puberty.

Deep learning technologies including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), have achieved success in finding ATAC-seq motifs. However, CNN-based methods are limited by the fixed width of the convolutional kernel, which makes it difficult to find multiple transcription factor binding sites with different lengths.

268,Impact of the inaccessible genome on genotype imputation and genome-wide association studies.,"Genotype imputation is widely used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, both the genotyping chips and imputation reference panels are dependent on next-generation sequencing (NGS). Due to the nature of NGS, some regions of the genome are inaccessible to sequencing. To date, there has been no complete evaluation of these regions and their impact on the identification of associations in GWAS remains unclear. In this study, we systematically assess the extent to which variants in inaccessible regions are underrepresented on genotyping chips and imputation reference panels, in GWAS results and in variant databases. We also determine the proportion of genes located in inaccessible regions and compare the results across variant masks defined by the 1000 Genomes Project and the TOPMed program. Overall, fewer variants were observed in inaccessible regions in all categories analyzed. Depending on the mask used and normalized for region size, only 4%-17% of the genotyped variants are located in inaccessible regions and 52 to 581 genes were almost completely inaccessible. From the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study, we present a case study of an association located in an inaccessible region that is driven by genotyped variants and cannot be reproduced by imputation in GRCh37. We conclude that genotyping, NGS, genotype imputation and downstream analyses such as GWAS and fine mapping are systematically biased in inaccessible regions, due to missed variants and spurious associations.

Enhancers regulate cell-type-specific transcription of tRNA genes by RNA polymerase III (Pol III). They are also responsible for the binding of the origin replication complex (ORC) to DNA replication origins, thereby regulating origin utilization, replication timing, and replication-dependent chromosome breaks. Additionally, enhancers regulate V(D)J recombination by increasing access of the recombination-activating gene (RAG) recombinase to target sites and by generating non-coding enhancer RNAs and localized regions of trimethylated histone H3-K4 recognized by the RAG2 PHD domain.

271,Expression of an endo-rhamnogalacturonase from Aspergillus aculeatus enhances release of Arabidopsis transparent mucilage.,"Mucilage is a gelatinous and sticky hydrophilic polysaccharide released from epidermal cells of seed coat after the hydration of mature seeds and is composed primarily of unbranched rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I). In this study, we produced a recombinant endo-RG-I hydrolase from Aspergillus aculeatus (AaRhgA) in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and examined its substrate preference for pyridylaminated (PA) RG-I with the various degrees of polymerization (DP). Recombinant AaRhgA requires PA-RG-I with a DP of 10 or higher for its hydrolase activity. We heterologously expressed the AarhgA gene under the strong constitutive promoter, cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, in Arabidopsis thaliana. In a series of biochemical analyses of each mucilage fraction released from the water-imbibed seeds of the transgenic plants, we found the enhanced deposition of the transparent mucilage layer that existed in the peripheral regions of the adherent mucilage and was not stained with ruthenium red.

272,Spatial enrichment and genomic analyses reveal the link of NOMO1 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe motor neuron disease with uncertain genetic predisposition in most sporadic cases. Spatial architecture of cell types and gene expression is the basis of cell-cell interactions, biological function and disease pathology, but is not well investigated in human motor cortex, a key ALS relevant brain region. Recent studies indicated single nucleus transcriptomic features of motor neuron vulnerability in ALS motor cortex. However, it remains largely unclear what is the brain regional vulnerability of ALS-associated genes, and what is the genetic link between region-specific genes and ALS risk. Here, we developed an entropy-weighted differential gene expression matrix-based tool (SpatialE) to identify the spatial enrichment of gene sets in spatial transcriptomics (ST). We benchmarked SpatialE against another enrichment tool (Multimodal Intersection Analysis, MIA) using ST data from both human and mouse brain tissues. To investigate regional vulnerability, we analyzed three human motor cortex and two dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues for spatial enrichment of ALS-associated genes. We also used Cell2location to estimate the abundance of cell types in ALS-related cortex layers. To dissect the link of regionally expressed genes and ALS risk, we performed burden analyses of rare loss-of-function (LOF) variants detected by whole-genome sequencing in ALS patients and controls, and then analyzed differential gene expression in the TargetALS RNA-seq dataset. SpatialE showed more accurate and specific spatial enrichment of regional cell type markers than MIA in both mouse brain and human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Spatial transcriptomic analyses of human motor cortex showed heterogenous cell types and spatial gene expression profiles. We found that 260 manually curated ALS-associated genes are significantly enriched in layer 5 (L5) motor cortex, with abundant expression of upper motor neurons and L5 excitatory neurons. Burden analyses of rare LOF variants in L5-associated genes nominated NOMO1 as a novel ALS-associated gene in a combined sample set of 6,814 ALS patients and 3,324 controls (P = 0.029). Gene expression analyses in central nervous system tissues revealed down-regulation of NOMO1 in ALS, which is consistent with a LOF disease mechanism. In conclusion, our integrated ST and genomic analyses identified regional brain vulnerability in ALS and the association of a L5 gene (NOMO1) with ALS risk.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643019/,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis al severe motor neuron disease uncertain genetic predisposition sporadic case spatial architecture cell type gene expression basis cellcell interaction biological function disease pathology well investigated human motor cortex key al relevant brain region recent study indicated single nucleus transcriptomic feature motor neuron vulnerability al motor cortex however remains largely unclear brain regional vulnerability alsassociated gene genetic link regionspecific gene al risk developed entropyweighted differential gene expression matrixbased tool spatiale identify spatial enrichment gene set spatial transcriptomics st benchmarked spatiale another enrichment tool multimodal intersection analysis mia using st data human mouse brain tissue investigate regional vulnerability analyzed three human motor cortex two dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue spatial enrichment alsassociated gene also used celllocation estimate abundance cell type alsrelated cortex layer dissect link regionally expressed gene al risk performed burden analysis rare lossoffunction lof variant detected wholegenome sequencing al patient control analyzed differential gene expression targetals rnaseq dataset spatiale showed accurate specific spatial enrichment regional cell type marker mia mouse brain human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex spatial transcriptomic analysis human motor cortex showed heterogenous cell type spatial gene expression profile found manually curated alsassociated gene significantly enriched layer l motor cortex abundant expression upper motor neuron l excitatory neuron burden analysis rare lof variant lassociated gene nominated nomo novel alsassociated gene combined sample set al patient control p gene expression analysis central nervous system tissue revealed downregulation nomo al consistent lof disease mechanism conclusion integrated st genomic analysis identified regional brain vulnerability al association l gene nomo al risk

276,Binding evolution of the Dengue Virus Envelope against DC-SIGN: A combined approach of phylogenetics and molecular dynamics analyses over 30 years of Dengue Virus in Brazil.,"The Red Queen Hypothesis (RQH), derived from Lewis Carroll's ""Through the Looking-Glass"", postulates that organisms must continually adapt in response to each other to maintain relative fitness. Within the context of host-pathogen interactions, the RQH implies an evolutionary arms race, wherein viruses evolve to exploit hosts and hosts evolve to resist viral invasion. This study delves into the dynamics of the RQH in the context of virus-cell interactions, specifically focusing on virus receptors and cell receptors. We observed multiple virus-host systems and noted patterns of co-evolution. As viruses evolved receptor-binding proteins to effectively engage with cell receptors, cells countered by altering their receptor genes. This ongoing mutual adaptation cycle has influenced the molecular intricacies of receptor-ligand interactions. Our data supports the RQH as a driving force behind the diversification and specialization of both viral and host cell receptors. Understanding this co-evolutionary dance offers insights into the unpredictability of emerging viral diseases and potential therapeutic interventions. Future research is crucial to dissect the nuanced molecular changes and the broader ecological consequences of this ever-evolving battle.

The fact that the genes coding for NDX and AOX have been lost from genomes of evolutionarily successful animal groups, such as vertebrates and insects, led us to investigate if the composition of the respiratory chain of Ciona and other tunicates differs significantly from that of humans and Drosophila, to accommodate the natural presence of AEs. We have failed to identify in tunicate genomes fifteen orthologous genes that code for subunits of the respiratory chain complexes; all of these putatively missing subunits are peripheral to complexes I, III and IV in mammals, and many are important for complex-complex interaction in supercomplexes (SCs), such as NDUFA11, UQCR11 and COX7A. Modeling of all respiratory chain subunit polypeptides of Ciona indicates significant structural divergence that is consistent with the lack of these fifteen clear orthologous subunits. We also provide evidence using Ciona AOX expressed in Drosophila that this AE cannot access the coenzyme Q pool reduced by complex I, but it is readily available to oxidize coenzyme Q molecules reduced by glycerophosphate oxidase, a mitochondrial inner membrane-bound dehydrogenase that is not involved in SCs. Altogether, our results suggest that Ciona AEs might have evolved in a mitochondrial inner membrane environment much different from that of mammals and insects, possibly without SCs; this correlates with the preferential functional interaction between these AEs and non-SC dehydrogenases in heterologous mammalian and insect systems. We discuss the implications of these findings for the applicability of Ciona AEs in human bypass therapies and for our understanding of the evolution of animal respiratory chain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642871/,respiratory chain alternative enzyme aes ndx aox tunicate ciona intestinalis ascidiacea xenotopically expressed characterized human cell culture model organism drosophila melanogaster mouse purpose developing bypass therapy combat mitochondrial disease human patient defective complex iiiiv respectively fact gene coding ndx aox lost genome evolutionarily successful animal group vertebrate insect led u investigate composition respiratory chain ciona tunicate differs significantly human drosophila accommodate natural presence aes failed identify tunicate genome fifteen orthologous gene code subunit respiratory chain complex putatively missing subunit peripheral complex iii iv mammal many important complexcomplex interaction supercomplexes sc ndufa uqcr coxa modeling respiratory chain subunit polypeptide ciona indicates significant structural divergence consistent lack fifteen clear orthologous subunit also provide evidence using ciona aox expressed drosophila ae access coenzyme q pool reduced complex readily available oxidize coenzyme q molecule reduced glycerophosphate oxidase mitochondrial inner membranebound dehydrogenase involved sc altogether result suggest ciona aes might evolved mitochondrial inner membrane environment much different mammal insect possibly without sc correlate preferential functional interaction aes nonsc dehydrogenases heterologous mammalian insect system discus implication finding applicability ciona aes human bypass therapy understanding evolution animal respiratory chain

282,"Intermittent fasting, exercise and dietary modification induce unique transcriptomic signatures of multiple tissues governing metabolic homeostasis during weight loss and rebound weight gain.","Obesity and its related metabolic diseases bring great challenges to public health. In-depth understanding on the efficacy of weight-loss interventions is critical for long-term weight control. Our study demonstrated the comparable efficacy of exercise (EX), intermittent fasting (IF), or the change of daily diet from an unhealthy to a normal chow (DR) for weight reduction, but largely divergently affected metabolic status and transcriptome of subcutaneous fat, scapular brown fat, skeletal muscles and liver in high-fat-high-fructose diet (HFHF) induced obese mice. EX and IF reduced systematic inflammation, improved glucose and lipid metabolism in liver and muscle, and amino acid metabolism and thermogenesis in adipose tissues. EX exhibited broad regulatory effects on TCA cycle, carbon metabolism, thermogenesis, propanoate-, fatty acid and amino acid metabolism across multiple tissues. IF prominently affected genes involved in mitophagy and autophagy in adipose tissues and core genes involved in butanoate metabolism in liver. DR however failed to improve metabolic homeostasis and biological dysfunctions in obese mice. Notably, by exploring potential inter-organ communication, we identified an obesity-resistant-like gene profile that were strongly correlated with HFHF induced metabolic derangements and could predict the degree of weight regain induced by the follow-up HFHF diet. Among them, 12 genes (e.g., Gdf15, Tfrc, Cdv3, Map2k4 and Nqo1) were causally associated with human metabolic traits, i.e., BMI, body fat mass, HbA1C, fasting glucose and cholesterol.

284,Advances in nuclear proteostasis of metazoans.,"The proteostasis network and associated protein quality control (PQC) mechanisms ensure proteome functionality and are essential for cell survival. A distinctive feature of eukaryotic cells is their high degree of compartmentalization, requiring specific and adapted proteostasis networks for each compartment. The nucleus, essential for maintaining the integrity of genetic information and gene transcription, is one such compartment. While PQC mechanisms have been investigated for decades in the cytoplasm and the endoplasmic reticulum, our knowledge of nuclear PQC pathways is only emerging. Recent developments in the field have underscored the importance of spatially managing aberrant proteins within the nucleus. Upon proteotoxic stress, misfolded proteins and PQC effectors accumulate in various nuclear membrane-less organelles. Beyond bringing together effectors and substrates, the biophysical properties of these organelles allow novel PQC functions.

Autosomal dominant lamellar ichthyosis (ADLI) is a rare condition, and ASPRV1 was the only gene linked to ADLI to date. We identified a heterozygous variant (ENST00000686631.1:c.1372G>T, p.(Val458Phe)) in the NKPD1 gene in seven individuals from a four-generation German pedigree with generalized lamellar ichthyosis by whole exome sequencing. Segregation analysis confirmed its presence in affected individuals, resulting in a LOD score of 3.31. NKPD1 encodes the NTPase KAP Family P-Loop Domain-Containing Protein 1, implicated in the plasma membrane, its role in human disease is as yet unknown. Skin histology showed moderate acanthosis and compact orthohyperkeratosis, and the ultrastructure differed clearly from that in ASPRV1-ADLI. While NKPD1 mRNA expression increased during keratinocyte differentiation, stratum corneum ceramides exhibited no significant changes.

In this study, 3-, 12- and 18- month-old APP/PS1 mice and WT littermates underwent memory tests, then synapse-related gene expression, class 1 histone deacetylases (HDACs) abundance, and H3K9ac levels at target gene promoters, were evaluated in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Our results showed recognition and long-term spatial memory impaired in 18-month-old WT mice and recognition, short-term working, and long-term spatial reference memory deficits in 12-and 18- month-old APP/PS1 mice. The memory impairments are associated with synapse-related gene nr2a, glur1, glur2, psd95 expression, HDAC abundance, and H3K9ac regulation. More specifically, HDAC 2 modulated synapse-related gene expression through H3K9ac at the gene promoters during aging and AD progression in the hippocampus. Conversely, HDAC 3 modulated synapse-related gene expression through H3K9ac at the gene promoters during AD progression in the PFC.

288,Architecture of β-Lactoglobulin Coating Modulates Bioinspired Alginate Dialdehyde-Gelatine/Polydopamine Scaffolds for Subchondral Bone Regeneration.,"In this study, we developed polydopamine (PDA)-functionalized alginate dialdehyde-gelatine (ADA-GEL) scaffolds for subchondral bone regeneration. These polymeric scaffolds were then coated with β-Lactoglobulin (β-LG) at concentrations of 1 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml. Morphological analysis indicated a homogeneous coating of the β-LG layer on the surface of network-like scaffolds. The β-LG-coated scaffolds exhibited improved swelling capacity as a function of the β-LG concentration. Compared to ADA-GEL/PDA scaffolds, the β-LG-coated scaffolds demonstrated delayed degradation and enhanced biomineralization. Here, a lower concentration of β-LG showed long-lasting stability and superior biomimetic hydroxyapatite mineralization. According to the theoretical findings, the single-state, representing the low concentration of β-LG, exhibited homogeneous distribution on the surface of the PDA, while the dimer-state (high concentration) displayed a high likelihood of uncontrolled interactions. β-LG-coated ADA-GEL/PDA scaffolds with a lower concentration of β-LG provided a biocompatible substrate that supported adhesion, proliferation, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) secretion of sheep bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, as well as increased expression of osteopontin (SPP1) and collagen type 1 (COL1A1) in human osteoblasts. These findings indicate the potential of protein-coated scaffolds for subchondral bone tissue regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study addresses a crucial aspect of osteochondral defect repair, emphasizing the pivotal role of subchondral bone regeneration. The development of polydopamine-functionalized alginate dialdehyde-gelatine (ADA-GEL) scaffolds, coated with β-Lactoglobulin (β-LG), represents a novel approach to potentially enhance subchondral bone repair. β-LG, a milk protein rich in essential amino acids and bioactive peptides, is investigated for its potential to promote subchondral bone regeneration. This research explores computationally and experimentally the influence of protein concentration on the ordered or irregular deposition, unravelling the interplay between coating structure, scaffold properties, and in-vitro performance.

289,CXXC5 drove inflammation and ovarian cancer proliferation via transcriptional activation of ZNF143 and EGR1.,"CXXC5, a zinc-finger protein, is known for its role in epigenetic regulation via binding to unmethylated CpG islands in gene promoters. As a transcription factor and epigenetic regulator, CXXC5 modulates various signaling processes and acts as a key coordinator. Altered expression or activity of CXXC5 has been linked to various pathological conditions, including tumorigenesis. Despite its known role in cancer, CXXC5's function and mechanism in ovarian cancer are unclear. We analyzed multiple public databases and found that CXXC5 is highly expressed in ovarian cancer, with high expression correlating with poor patient prognosis. We show that CXXC5 expression is regulated by oxygen concentration and is a direct target of HIF1A. CXXC5 is critical for maintaining the proliferative potential of ovarian cancer cells, with knockdown decreasing and overexpression increasing cell proliferation. Loss of CXXC5 led to inactivation of multiple inflammatory signaling pathways, while overexpression activated these pathways. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we confirmed ZNF143 and EGR1 as downstream transcription factors of CXXC5, mediating its proliferative potential in ovarian cancer. Our findings suggest that the CXXC5-ZNF143/EGR1 axis forms a network driving ovarian cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, and highlight CXXC5 as a potential therapeutic target for ovarian cancer treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642782/,cxxc zincfinger protein known role epigenetic regulation via binding unmethylated cpg island gene promoter transcription factor epigenetic regulator cxxc modulates various signaling process act key coordinator altered expression activity cxxc linked various pathological condition including tumorigenesis despite known role cancer cxxcs function mechanism ovarian cancer unclear analyzed multiple public database found cxxc highly expressed ovarian cancer high expression correlating poor patient prognosis show cxxc expression regulated oxygen concentration direct target hifa cxxc critical maintaining proliferative potential ovarian cancer cell knockdown decreasing overexpression increasing cell proliferation loss cxxc led inactivation multiple inflammatory signaling pathway overexpression activated pathway vitro vivo experiment confirmed znf egr downstream transcription factor cxxc mediating proliferative potential ovarian cancer finding suggest cxxcznfegr axis form network driving ovarian cell proliferation tumorigenesis highlight cxxc potential therapeutic target ovarian cancer treatment

294,Nitrogen fertilization modulates rice phyllosphere functional genes and pathogens through fungal communities.,"The phyllosphere is a vital yet often neglected habitat hosting diverse microorganisms with various functions. However, studies regarding how the composition and functions of the phyllosphere microbiome respond to agricultural practices, like nitrogen fertilization, are limited. This study investigated the effects of long-term nitrogen fertilization with different levels (CK, N90, N210, N330) on the functional genes and pathogens of the rice phyllosphere microbiome. Results showed that the relative abundance of many microbial functional genes in the rice phyllosphere was significantly affected by nitrogen fertilization, especially those involved in C fixation and denitrification genes. Different nitrogen fertilization levels have greater effects on fungal communities than bacteria communities in the rice phyllosphere, and network analysis and structural equation models further elucidate that fungal communities not only changed bacterial-fungal inter-kingdom interactions in the phyllosphere but also contributed to the variation of biogeochemical cycle potential. Besides, the moderate nitrogen fertilization level (N210) was associated with an enrichment of beneficial microbes in the phyllosphere, while also resulting in the lowest abundance of pathogenic fungi (1.14 %). In contrast, the highest abundance of pathogenic fungi (1.64 %) was observed in the highest nitrogen fertilization level (N330). This enrichment of pathogen due to high nitrogen level was also regulated by the fungal communities, as revealed through SEM analysis. Together, we demonstrated that the phyllosphere fungal communities were more sensitive to the nitrogen fertilization levels and played a crucial role in influencing phyllosphere functional profiles including element cycling potential and pathogen abundance. This study expands our knowledge regarding the role of phyllosphere fungal communities in modulating the element cycling and plant health in sustainable agriculture.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642761/,phyllosphere vital yet often neglected habitat hosting diverse microorganism various function however study regarding composition function phyllosphere microbiome respond agricultural practice like nitrogen fertilization limited study investigated effect longterm nitrogen fertilization different level ck n n n functional gene pathogen rice phyllosphere microbiome result showed relative abundance many microbial functional gene rice phyllosphere significantly affected nitrogen fertilization especially involved c fixation denitrification gene different nitrogen fertilization level greater effect fungal community bacteria community rice phyllosphere network analysis structural equation model elucidate fungal community changed bacterialfungal interkingdom interaction phyllosphere also contributed variation biogeochemical cycle potential besides moderate nitrogen fertilization level n associated enrichment beneficial microbe phyllosphere also resulting lowest abundance pathogenic fungi contrast highest abundance pathogenic fungi observed highest nitrogen fertilization level n enrichment pathogen due high nitrogen level also regulated fungal community revealed sem analysis together demonstrated phyllosphere fungal community sensitive nitrogen fertilization level played crucial role influencing phyllosphere functional profile including element cycling potential pathogen abundance study expands knowledge regarding role phyllosphere fungal community modulating element cycling plant health sustainable agriculture

In this study, a two-generation rearing experiment was conducted using mature Mesocentrotus nudus, a major edible sea urchin that occurs along the coasts of northern Japan. Morphological observations and comprehensive gene expression analysis (RNA-seq) of resulting larvae were performed to examine transgenerational acclimation to acidified seawater. Two generations of rearing experiments showed that larvae derived from parents acclimated to acidified seawater tended to have higher survival and show less reduction in body size when exposed to acidified seawater of the same pH, suggesting that a positive carry-over effect occurred. RNA-seq analysis showed that gene expression patterns of larvae originated from both acclimated and non-acclimated parents to acidified seawater tended to be different than control condition, and the gene expression pattern of larvae originated from acclimated parents was substantially different than that of larvae of non-acclimated and control parents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642751/,transgenerational response susceptible calcifying organism progressive ocean acidification important issue reducing uncertainty future prediction study twogeneration rearing experiment conducted using mature mesocentrotus nudus major edible sea urchin occurs along coast northern japan morphological observation comprehensive gene expression analysis rnaseq resulting larva performed examine transgenerational acclimation acidified seawater two generation rearing experiment showed larva derived parent acclimated acidified seawater tended higher survival show le reduction body size exposed acidified seawater ph suggesting positive carryover effect occurred rnaseq analysis showed gene expression pattern larva originated acclimated nonacclimated parent acidified seawater tended different control condition gene expression pattern larva originated acclimated parent substantially different larva nonacclimated control parent
296,Coping with salinity extremes: Gill transcriptome profiling in the black-chinned tilapia (Sarotherodon melanotheron).,"Steeper and sometimes extreme salinity gradients increasingly affect aquatic organisms because of climate change. Hypersalinity habitats demand powerful physiological adaptive strategies. Few teleost species have the capacity to spend their whole life cycle in salinities way over seawater levels. Focusing on the multifunctional gill, we unraveled the tilapia S. melanotheron key strategies to cope with different environmental conditions, ranging from freshwater up to hypersaline habitats. De novo transcriptome assembly based on RNAseq allowed for the analysis of 40,967 annotated transcripts among samples collected in three wild populations at 0, 40 and 80 ‰. A trend analysis of the expression patterns revealed responses across the salinity gradient with different gene pathways involved. Genes linked to ion transport, pH regulation and cell surface receptor signaling were mainly upregulated in the high salinity habitat. We identified tight junction proteins that were critical in high salinity habitats and that were different from the well-known tightening junctional proteins identified and expressed in fresh water. Expression profiles also suggest a change in the vascular tone that could be linked to an osmorespiratory compromise not only in fresh water, but also in high salinity environments. A striking downregulation of genes linked to the immune system and to the heat shock response was observed suggesting an energetic trade-off between immunity and acclimation/adaptation in the hypersaline habitat.

297,Differential impact of intermittent versus continuous treatment with clozapine on fatty acid metabolism in the brain of an MK-801-induced mouse model of schizophrenia.,"Continuous antipsychotic treatment is often recommended to prevent relapse in schizophrenia. However, the efficacy of antipsychotic treatment appears to diminish in patients with relapsed schizophrenia and the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Moreover, though the findings are inconclusive, several recent studies suggest that intermittent versus continuous treatment may not significantly differ in recurrence risk and therapeutic efficacy but potentially reduce the drug dose and side effects. Notably, disturbances in fatty acid (FA) metabolism are linked to the onset/relapse of schizophrenia, and patients with multi-episode schizophrenia have been reported to have reduced FA biosynthesis. We thus utilized an MK-801-induced animal model of schizophrenia to evaluate whether two treatment strategies of clozapine would affect drug response and FA metabolism differently in the brain. Schizophrenia-related behaviors were assessed through open field test (OFT) and prepulse inhibition (PPI) test, and FA profiles of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additionally, we measured gene expression levels of enzymes involved in FA synthesis. Both intermittent and continuous clozapine treatment reversed hypermotion and deficits in PPI in mice. Continuous treatment decreased total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and FAs in the PFC, whereas the intermittent administration increased n-6 PUFAs, SFAs and FAs compared to continuous administration. Meanwhile, continuous treatment reduced the expression of Fads1 and Elovl2, while intermittent treatment significantly upregulated them. This study discloses the novel findings that there was no significant difference in clozapine efficacy between continuous and intermittent administration, but intermittent treatment showed certain protective effects on phospholipid metabolism in the PFC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642730/,continuous antipsychotic treatment often recommended prevent relapse schizophrenia however efficacy antipsychotic treatment appears diminish patient relapsed schizophrenia underlying mechanism still unknown moreover though finding inconclusive several recent study suggest intermittent versus continuous treatment may significantly differ recurrence risk therapeutic efficacy potentially reduce drug dose side effect notably disturbance fatty acid fa metabolism linked onsetrelapse schizophrenia patient multiepisode schizophrenia reported reduced fa biosynthesis thus utilized mkinduced animal model schizophrenia evaluate whether two treatment strategy clozapine would affect drug response fa metabolism differently brain schizophreniarelated behavior assessed open field test oft prepulse inhibition ppi test fa profile prefrontal cortex pfc hippocampus analyzed gas chromatographymass spectrometry additionally measured gene expression level enzyme involved fa synthesis intermittent continuous clozapine treatment reversed hypermotion deficit ppi mouse continuous treatment decreased total polyunsaturated fatty acid pufas saturated fatty acid sfas fa pfc whereas intermittent administration increased n pufas sfas fa compared continuous administration meanwhile continuous treatment reduced expression fad elovl intermittent treatment significantly upregulated study discloses novel finding significant difference clozapine efficacy continuous intermittent administration intermittent treatment showed certain protective effect phospholipid metabolism pfc
298,A review of DNA nanoparticles-encapsulated drug/gene/protein for advanced controlled drug release: Current status and future perspective over emerging therapy approaches.,"In the last ten years, the field of nanomedicine has experienced significant progress in creating novel drug delivery systems (DDSs). An effective strategy involves employing DNA nanoparticles (NPs) as carriers to encapsulate drugs, genes, or proteins, facilitating regulated drug release. This abstract examines the utilization of DNA NPs and their potential applications in strategies for controlled drug release. Researchers have utilized the distinctive characteristics of DNA molecules, including their ability to self-assemble and their compatibility with living organisms, to create NPs specifically for the purpose of delivering drugs. The DNA NPs possess numerous benefits compared to conventional drug carriers, such as exceptional stability, adjustable dimensions and structure, and convenient customization. Researchers have successfully achieved a highly efficient encapsulation of different therapeutic agents by carefully designing their structure and composition. This advancement enables precise and targeted delivery of drugs. The incorporation of drugs, genes, or proteins into DNA NPs provides notable advantages in terms of augmenting therapeutic effectiveness while reducing adverse effects. DNA NPs serve as a protective barrier for the enclosed payloads, preventing their degradation and extending their duration in the body. The protective effect is especially vital for delicate biologics, such as proteins or gene-based therapies that could otherwise be vulnerable to enzymatic degradation or quick elimination. Moreover, the surface of DNA NPs can be altered to facilitate specific targeting towards particular tissues or cells, thereby augmenting the accuracy of delivery. A significant benefit of DNA NPs is their capacity to regulate the kinetics of drug release. Through the manipulation of the DNA NPs structure, scientists can regulate the rate at which the enclosed cargo is released, enabling a prolonged and regulated dispensation of medication. This control is crucial for medications with limited therapeutic ranges or those necessitating uninterrupted administration to attain optimal therapeutic results. In addition, DNA NPs have the ability to react to external factors, including alterations in temperature, pH, or light, which can initiate the release of the payload at precise locations or moments. This feature enhances the precision of drug release control. The potential uses of DNA NPs in the controlled release of medicines are extensive. The NPs have the ability to transport various therapeutic substances, for example, drugs, peptides, NAs (NAs), and proteins. They exhibit potential for the therapeutic management of diverse ailments, including cancer, genetic disorders, and infectious diseases. In addition, DNA NPs can be employed for targeted drug delivery, traversing biological barriers, and surpassing the constraints of conventional drug administration methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642693/,last ten year field nanomedicine experienced significant progress creating novel drug delivery system dds effective strategy involves employing dna nanoparticles np carrier encapsulate drug gene protein facilitating regulated drug release abstract examines utilization dna np potential application strategy controlled drug release researcher utilized distinctive characteristic dna molecule including ability selfassemble compatibility living organism create np specifically purpose delivering drug dna np posse numerous benefit compared conventional drug carrier exceptional stability adjustable dimension structure convenient customization researcher successfully achieved highly efficient encapsulation different therapeutic agent carefully designing structure composition advancement enables precise targeted delivery drug incorporation drug gene protein dna np provides notable advantage term augmenting therapeutic effectiveness reducing adverse effect dna np serve protective barrier enclosed payload preventing degradation extending duration body protective effect especially vital delicate biologics protein genebased therapy could otherwise vulnerable enzymatic degradation quick elimination moreover surface dna np altered facilitate specific targeting towards particular tissue cell thereby augmenting accuracy delivery significant benefit dna np capacity regulate kinetics drug release manipulation dna np structure scientist regulate rate enclosed cargo released enabling prolonged regulated dispensation medication control crucial medication limited therapeutic range necessitating uninterrupted administration attain optimal therapeutic result addition dna np ability react external factor including alteration temperature ph light initiate release payload precise location moment feature enhances precision drug release control potential us dna np controlled release medicine extensive np ability transport various therapeutic substance example drug peptide na na protein exhibit potential therapeutic management diverse ailment including cancer genetic disorder infectious disease addition dna np employed targeted drug delivery traversing biological barrier surpassing constraint conventional drug administration method
299,Goat milk exosomal microRNAs alleviate LPS-induced intestinal inflammation in mice.,"Intestinal inflammation is a common digestive system disease. Milk-derived exosomes can participate in intercellular communication and transport a variety of bioactive components, and the microRNAs (miRNAs) they carry play important roles in a variety of biological processes in the body. At present, the preventive effect and mechanism of action of goat milk exosomes and their derived miRNAs on intestinal inflammation are still unclear. In this study, the protective effect of goat milk exosomes on LPS-induced intestinal inflammation was investigated using mouse intestinal inflammation model and IEC-6 cell inflammation model. Small RNA sequencing was used to analyze the miRNA expression profile of goat milk exosomes. In this study, C-Exo and M-Exo alleviated intestinal inflammation by reducing the LPS-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines, inhibiting the increase in the NLRP3 protein and the activation of the TLR4/NFκB signaling pathway. C-Exo has a more significant inhibitory effect on them, and better therapeutic efficacy than M-Exo. Notably, the target genes of miRNAs in C-Exo and M-Exo were significantly enriched in immune-related pathways. Furthermore, their derived miR-26a-5p and miR-30a-5p were found to ameliorate the IEC-6 inflammatory response. These findings suggest that miRNAs in goat milk exosomes have the potential to attenuate LPS-induced intestinal inflammation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642690/,intestinal inflammation common digestive system disease milkderived exosomes participate intercellular communication transport variety bioactive component micrornas mirnas carry play important role variety biological process body present preventive effect mechanism action goat milk exosomes derived mirnas intestinal inflammation still unclear study protective effect goat milk exosomes lpsinduced intestinal inflammation investigated using mouse intestinal inflammation model iec cell inflammation model small rna sequencing used analyze mirna expression profile goat milk exosomes study cexo mexo alleviated intestinal inflammation reducing lpsinduced release proinflammatory cytokine inhibiting increase nlrp protein activation tlrnfb signaling pathway cexo significant inhibitory effect better therapeutic efficacy mexo notably target gene mirnas cexo mexo significantly enriched immunerelated pathway furthermore derived mirap mirap found ameliorate iec inflammatory response finding suggest mirnas goat milk exosomes potential attenuate lpsinduced intestinal inflammation
300,Chemo-photothermal therapy of chitosan/gold nanorod clusters for antibacterial treatment against the infection of planktonic and biofilm MRSA.,"Bacterial infections trigger inflammation and impede the closure of skin wounds. The misuse of antibiotics exacerbates skin infections by generating multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this study, we developed chemo-photothermal therapy (chemo-PTT) based on near-infrared (NIR)-irradiated chitosan/gold nanorod (GNR) clusters as anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) agents. The nanocomposites exhibited an average size of 223 nm with a surface charge of 36 mV. These plasmonic nanocomposites demonstrated on-demand and rapid hyperthermal action under NIR. The combined effect of positive charge and PTT by NIR-irradiated nanocomposites resulted in a remarkable inhibition rate of 96 % against planktonic MRSA, indicating a synergistic activity compared to chitosan nanoparticles or GNR alone. The nanocomposites easily penetrated the biofilm matrix. The combination of chemical and photothermal treatments by NIR-stimulated clusters significantly damaged the biofilm structure, eradicating MRSA inside the biomass. NIR-irradiated chitosan/GNR clusters increased the skin temperature of mice by 13 °C. The plasmonic nanocomposites induced negligible skin irritation in vivo.

301,"Exosomes derived from vMIP-II-Lamp2b gene-modified M2 cells provide neuroprotection by targeting the injured spinal cord, inhibiting chemokine signals and modulating microglia/macrophage polarization in mice.","Inflammation is one of the key injury factors for spinal cord injury (SCI). Exosomes (Exos) derived from M2 macrophages have been shown to inhibit inflammation and be beneficial in SCI animal models. However, lacking targetability restricts their application prospects. Considering that chemokine receptors increase dramatically after SCI, viral macrophage inflammatory protein II (vMIP-II) is a broad-spectrum chemokine receptor binding peptide, and lysosomal associated membrane protein 2b (Lamp2b) is the key membrane component of Exos, we speculated that vMIP-II-Lamp2b gene-modified M2 macrophage-derived Exos (vMIP-II-Lamp2b-M2-Exo) not only have anti-inflammatory properties, but also can target the injured area by vMIP-II. In this study, using a murine contusive SCI model, we revealed that vMIP-II-Lamp2b-M2-Exo could target the chemokine receptors which highly expressed in the injured spinal cords, inhibit some key chemokine receptor signaling pathways (such as MAPK and Akt), further inhibit proinflammatory factors (such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, IL-18, TNF-α, and iNOS), and promote anti-inflammatory factors (such as IL-4 and Arg1) productions, and the transformation of microglia/macrophages from M1 into M2. Moreover, the improved histological and functional recoveries were also found. Collectively, our results suggest that vMIP-II-Lamp2b-M2-Exo may provide neuroprotection by targeting the injured spinal cord, inhibiting some chemokine signals, reducing proinflammatory factor production and modulating microglia/macrophage polarization.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642665/,inflammation one key injury factor spinal cord injury sci exosomes exos derived macrophage shown inhibit inflammation beneficial sci animal model however lacking targetability restricts application prospect considering chemokine receptor increase dramatically sci viral macrophage inflammatory protein ii vmipii broadspectrum chemokine receptor binding peptide lysosomal associated membrane protein b lampb key membrane component exos speculated vmipiilampb genemodified macrophagederived exos vmipiilampbmexo antiinflammatory property also target injured area vmipii study using murine contusive sci model revealed vmipiilampbmexo could target chemokine receptor highly expressed injured spinal cord inhibit key chemokine receptor signaling pathway mapk akt inhibit proinflammatory factor il il il il tnf inos promote antiinflammatory factor il arg production transformation microgliamacrophages moreover improved histological functional recovery also found collectively result suggest vmipiilampbmexo may provide neuroprotection targeting injured spinal cord inhibiting chemokine signal reducing proinflammatory factor production modulating microgliamacrophage polarization

303,Single-cell analysis identifies critical regulators of spermatogonial development and differentiation in cattle-yak bulls.,"Spermatogenesis is a continuous process in which functional sperm are produced through a series of mitotic and meiotic divisions and morphological changes in germ cells. The aberrant development and fate transitions of spermatogenic cells cause hybrid sterility in mammals. Cattle-yak, a hybrid animal between taurine cattle (Bos taurus) and yak (Bos grunniens), exhibits male-specific sterility due to spermatogenic failure. In the present study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to identify differences in testicular cell composition and the developmental trajectory of spermatogenic cells between yak and cattle-yak. The composition and molecular signatures of spermatogonial subtypes were dramatically different between these 2 animals, and the expression of genes associated with stem cell maintenance, cell differentiation and meiotic entry was altered in cattle-yak, indicating the impairment of undifferentiated spermatogonial fate decisions. Cell communication analysis revealed that signaling within different spermatogenic cell subpopulations was weakened, and progenitor spermatogonia were unable or delayed receiving and sending signals for transformation to the next stage in cattle-yak. Simultaneously, the communication between niche cells and germ cells was also abnormal. Collectively, we obtained the expression profiles of transcriptome signatures of different germ cells and testicular somatic cell populations at the single-cell level and identified critical regulators of spermatogonial differentiation and meiosis in yak and sterile cattle-yak. The findings of this study shed light on the genetic mechanisms that lead to hybrid sterility and speciation in bovid species.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642661/,spermatogenesis continuous process functional sperm produced series mitotic meiotic division morphological change germ cell aberrant development fate transition spermatogenic cell cause hybrid sterility mammal cattleyak hybrid animal taurine cattle bos taurus yak bos grunniens exhibit malespecific sterility due spermatogenic failure present study performed singlecell rna sequencing analysis identify difference testicular cell composition developmental trajectory spermatogenic cell yak cattleyak composition molecular signature spermatogonial subtypes dramatically different animal expression gene associated stem cell maintenance cell differentiation meiotic entry altered cattleyak indicating impairment undifferentiated spermatogonial fate decision cell communication analysis revealed signaling within different spermatogenic cell subpopulation weakened progenitor spermatogonia unable delayed receiving sending signal transformation next stage cattleyak simultaneously communication niche cell germ cell also abnormal collectively obtained expression profile transcriptome signature different germ cell testicular somatic cell population singlecell level identified critical regulator spermatogonial differentiation meiosis yak sterile cattleyak finding study shed light genetic mechanism lead hybrid sterility speciation bovid specie
304,Endometrial responsiveness to interferon-tau and its association with subsequent reproductive performance in dairy heifers.,"Our objectives were to evaluate the endometrial responsiveness of dairy heifers to an intrauterine infusion of recombinant bovine interferon-tau (rbIFN-τ) and to associate endometrial responses to rbIFN-τ with subsequent reproductive performance. In Experiments 1 and 2, cyclic heifers were enrolled in a 5-d CIDR Cosynch program for estrous synchronization, and blood sampling and ultrasonography examinations were performed on d 0, 4, 7, 11, and 14 of the estrous cycle. In Experiment 1, heifers were randomly assigned to receive an intrauterine infusion containing 2 µg of rbIFN-τ (rbIFN-τ = 19) or saline (CTRL = 19) into the uterine horn ipsilateral to the corpus luteum (CL) on d 14 of the estrous cycle. Six hours after the infusion, the infused uterine horn was flushed for sampling of the uterine luminal fluid (ULF) for analyses of composition, and the endometrium was biopsied for transcriptomics. In Experiment 2, 100 heifers received an intrauterine infusion of rbIFN-τ, and the same procedures for uterine sample collection described in Experiment 1 were performed. After the intrauterine test, heifers were enrolled in a breeding program and classified as highly fertile (HF; pregnant at first AI) or subfertile (SF; not pregnant at first AI). Statistical analyses were performed using linear regression models, which included the effects of treatment (Experiment 1: CTRL vs. rbIFN-τ) or fertility group (Experiment 2: HF vs. SF) and block of samples. Intrauterine infusion of rbIFN-τ increased the expression of classical interferon-stimulated genes in the endometrium (e.g., ISG15, MX1, OAS2, IRF9, and USP18), and an antiviral response was predicted to be the main downstream effect of the transcriptome changes. In addition, rbIFN-τ increased the abundance of cholesterol, glycerol, and the overall concentration of oxylipins in the ULF. Analysis of endometrial transcriptome between HF and SF heifers revealed important differences in the expression of proteins associated with cell signaling, metabolism, attachment, and migration, with a large representation of genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins. In general, differently expressed genes were expected to be downregulated by IFN-τ but seemed to fail to be downregulated in SF heifers, resulting in higher expression in SF compared with HF heifers. Subfertile heifers had lower concentrations of glycerol and an altered profile of oxylipins in the ULF, with lower abundance of oxylipins derived from arachidonic acid and dihomo-γ-linolenic acid, and greater abundance of oxylipins derived from linoleic acid. Measurements of ovarian function did not differ between groups and, therefore, did not influence the observed results in uterine biology. In conclusion, the endometrial responsiveness to IFN-τ is variable among individuals and associated with subsequent fertility of heifers, indicating that communication between conceptus and endometrium is critical for the uterine receptivity and survival of pregnancy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642656/,objective evaluate endometrial responsiveness dairy heifer intrauterine infusion recombinant bovine interferontau rbifn associate endometrial response rbifn subsequent reproductive performance experiment cyclic heifer enrolled cidr cosynch program estrous synchronization blood sampling ultrasonography examination performed estrous cycle experiment heifer randomly assigned receive intrauterine infusion containing g rbifn rbifn saline ctrl uterine horn ipsilateral corpus luteum cl estrous cycle six hour infusion infused uterine horn flushed sampling uterine luminal fluid ulf analysis composition endometrium biopsied transcriptomics experiment heifer received intrauterine infusion rbifn procedure uterine sample collection described experiment performed intrauterine test heifer enrolled breeding program classified highly fertile hf pregnant first ai subfertile sf pregnant first ai statistical analysis performed using linear regression model included effect treatment experiment ctrl v rbifn fertility group experiment hf v sf block sample intrauterine infusion rbifn increased expression classical interferonstimulated gene endometrium eg isg mx oas irf usp antiviral response predicted main downstream effect transcriptome change addition rbifn increased abundance cholesterol glycerol overall concentration oxylipins ulf analysis endometrial transcriptome hf sf heifer revealed important difference expression protein associated cell signaling metabolism attachment migration large representation gene encoding extracellular matrix protein general differently expressed gene expected downregulated ifn seemed fail downregulated sf heifer resulting higher expression sf compared hf heifer subfertile heifer lower concentration glycerol altered profile oxylipins ulf lower abundance oxylipins derived arachidonic acid dihomolinolenic acid greater abundance oxylipins derived linoleic acid measurement ovarian function differ group therefore influence observed result uterine biology conclusion endometrial responsiveness ifn variable among individual associated subsequent fertility heifer indicating communication conceptus endometrium critical uterine receptivity survival pregnancy
305,HH5 Double-Carrier Embryos Fail to Progress through Early Conceptus Elongation.,"Massive genotyping in cattle has uncovered several deleterious haplotypes that cause pre-term mortality. Holstein Haplotype 5 (HH5) is a deleterious haplotype present in the Holstein Friesian population that involves the ablation of the Transcription Factor B1 mitochondrial (TFB1M) gene. The developmental stage at which HH5 double-carrier (DC, homozygous) embryos or fetuses die remains unknown and this is a relevant information to estimate the economic losses associated to the inadvertent cross between carriers. To determine if HH5 DC survive to maternal recognition of pregnancy, embryonic day (E)14 embryos were flushed from superovulated carrier cows inseminated with a carrier bull. DC E14 conceptuses were recovered at Mendelian rates but they failed to achieve early elongation, as evidenced by a drastic (>26-fold) reduction in the proliferation of extraembryonic membranes compared with carrier or non-carrier embryos. To assess development at earlier stages, TFB1M knockout (KO) embryos -functionally equivalent to DC embryos- were generated by CRISPR technology and cultured to the blastocyst stage -Day (D)8- and to the early embryonic disc stage -D12-. No significant effect of TFB1M ablation was observed on the differentiation and proliferation of embryonic lineages and relative mtDNA content up to D12. In conclusion, HH5 DC embryos are able to develop to early embryonic disc stage but fail to undergo early conceptus elongation, required for pregnancy recognition.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642647/,massive genotyping cattle uncovered several deleterious haplotype cause preterm mortality holstein haplotype hh deleterious haplotype present holstein friesian population involves ablation transcription factor b mitochondrial tfbm gene developmental stage hh doublecarrier dc homozygous embryo fetus die remains unknown relevant information estimate economic loss associated inadvertent cross carrier determine hh dc survive maternal recognition pregnancy embryonic day e embryo flushed superovulated carrier cow inseminated carrier bull dc e conceptus recovered mendelian rate failed achieve early elongation evidenced drastic fold reduction proliferation extraembryonic membrane compared carrier noncarrier embryo ass development earlier stage tfbm knockout ko embryo functionally equivalent dc embryo generated crispr technology cultured blastocyst stage day early embryonic disc stage significant effect tfbm ablation observed differentiation proliferation embryonic lineage relative mtdna content conclusion hh dc embryo able develop early embryonic disc stage fail undergo early conceptus elongation required pregnancy recognition
306,Harnessing artificial intelligence-driven approach for enhanced indole-3-acetic acid from the newly isolated Streptomyces rutgersensis AW08.,"Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) derived from Actinobacteria fermentations on agro-wastes constitutes a safer and low-cost alternative to synthetic IAA. This study aims to select a high IAA-producing Streptomyces-like strain isolated from Lake Oubeira sediments (El Kala, Algeria) for further investigations (i.e., 16S rRNA gene barcoding and process optimization). Subsequently, artificial intelligence-based approaches were employed to maximize IAA bioproduction on spent coffee grounds as high-value-added feedstock. The specificity was the novel application of the Limited-Memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno Box (L-BFGS-B) optimization algorithm. The new strain AW08 was a significant producer of IAA (26.116 ± 0.61 μg/mL) and was identified as Streptomyces rutgersensis by 16S rRNA gene barcoding and phylogenetic inquiry. The empirical data involved the inoculation of AW08 in various cultural conditions according to a four-factor Box Behnken Design matrix (BBD) of Response surface methodology (RSM). The input parameters and regression equation extracted from the RSM-BBD were the basis for implementing and training the L-BFGS-B algorithm. Upon training the model, the optimal conditions suggested by the BBD and L-BFGS-B algorithm were, respectively, L-Trp (X1) = 0.58 %; 0.57 %; T° (X2) = 26.37 °C; 28.19 °C; pH (X3) = 7.75; 8.59; and carbon source (X4) = 30 %; 33.29 %, with the predicted response IAA (Y) =152.8; 169.18 μg/mL). Our findings emphasize the potential of the multifunctional S. rutgersensis AW08, isolated and reported for the first time in Algeria, as a robust producer of IAA. Validation investigations using the bioprocess parameters provided by the L-BFGS-B and the BBD-RSM models demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-driven optimization in maximizing IAA output by 5.43-fold and 4.2-fold, respectively.

307,The nucleolus: Coordinating stress response and genomic stability.,"The perception that the nucleoli are merely the organelles where ribosome biogenesis occurs is challenged. Only around 30 % of nucleolar proteins are solely involved in producing ribosomes. Instead, the nucleolus plays a critical role in controlling protein trafficking during stress and, according to its dynamic nature, undergoes continuous protein exchange with nucleoplasm under various cellular stressors. Hence, the concept of nucleolar stress has evolved as cellular insults that disrupt the structure and function of the nucleolus. Considering the emerging role of this organelle in DNA repair and the fact that rDNAs are the most fragile genomic loci, therapies targeting the nucleoli are increasingly being developed. Besides, drugs that target ribosome synthesis and induce nucleolar stress can be used in cancer therapy. In contrast, agents that regulate nucleolar activity may be a potential treatment for neurodegeneration caused by abnormal protein accumulation in the nucleolus.

310,Polymorphisms in the cysteine dioxygenase gene and their association with taurine content in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas.,"The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is rich in taurine, which is crucial for its adaptation to the fluctuating intertidal environment and presents significant potential in improving taurine nutrition and boosting immunity in humans. Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) is a key enzyme involved in the initial step of taurine biosynthesis and plays a crucial role in regulating taurine content in the body. In the present study, polymorphisms of CDO gene in C. gigas (CgCDO) and their association with taurine content were evaluated in 198 individuals. A total of 24 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci were identified in the exonic region of the CgCDO gene by direct sequencing. Among these SNPs, c.279G > A and c.287C > A were found to be significantly associated with taurine content, with the GG and AA genotype at the two loci exhibiting enhanced taurine accumulation (p < 0.05). Haplotype analysis revealed that the 279GG/287AA haplotype had the highest taurine content of 29.24 mg/g, while the 279AA/287CC haplotype showed the lowest taurine content of 21.19 mg/g.

311,Network model of skeletal muscle cell signalling predicts differential responses to endurance and resistance exercise training.,"Exercise-induced muscle adaptations vary based on exercise modality and intensity. We constructed a signalling network model from 87 published studies of human or rodent skeletal muscle cell responses to endurance or resistance exercise in vivo or simulated exercise in vitro. The network comprises 259 signalling interactions between 120 nodes, representing eight membrane receptors and eight canonical signalling pathways regulating 14 transcriptional regulators, 28 target genes and 12 exercise-induced phenotypes. Using this network, we formulated a logic-based ordinary differential equation model predicting time-dependent molecular and phenotypic alterations following acute endurance and resistance exercises. Compared with nine independent studies, the model accurately predicted 18/21 (85%) acute responses to resistance exercise and 12/16 (75%) acute responses to endurance exercise. Detailed sensitivity analysis of differential phenotypic responses to resistance and endurance training showed that, in the model, exercise regulates cell growth and protein synthesis primarily by signalling via mechanistic target of rapamycin, which is activated by Akt and inhibited in endurance exercise by AMP-activated protein kinase. Endurance exercise preferentially activates inflammation via reactive oxygen species and nuclear factor κB signalling. Furthermore, the expected preferential activation of mitochondrial biogenesis by endurance exercise was counterbalanced in the model by protein kinase C in response to resistance training. This model provides a new tool for investigating cross-talk between skeletal muscle signalling pathways activated by endurance and resistance exercise, and the mechanisms of interactions such as the interference effects of endurance training on resistance exercise outcomes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643471/,exerciseinduced muscle adaptation vary based exercise modality intensity constructed signalling network model published study human rodent skeletal muscle cell response endurance resistance exercise vivo simulated exercise vitro network comprises signalling interaction node representing eight membrane receptor eight canonical signalling pathway regulating transcriptional regulator target gene exerciseinduced phenotype using network formulated logicbased ordinary differential equation model predicting timedependent molecular phenotypic alteration following acute endurance resistance exercise compared nine independent study model accurately predicted acute response resistance exercise acute response endurance exercise detailed sensitivity analysis differential phenotypic response resistance endurance training showed model exercise regulates cell growth protein synthesis primarily signalling via mechanistic target rapamycin activated akt inhibited endurance exercise ampactivated protein kinase endurance exercise preferentially activates inflammation via reactive oxygen specie nuclear factor b signalling furthermore expected preferential activation mitochondrial biogenesis endurance exercise counterbalanced model protein kinase c response resistance training model provides new tool investigating crosstalk skeletal muscle signalling pathway activated endurance resistance exercise mechanism interaction interference effect endurance training resistance exercise outcome

316,Improving the production of carbamoyltobramycin by an industrial Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius through metabolic engineering.,"Tobramycin is an essential and extensively used broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic obtained through alkaline hydrolysis of carbamoyltobramycin, one of the fermentation products of Streptoalloteichus tenebrarius. To simplify the composition of fermentation products from industrial strain, the main byproduct apramycin was blocked by gene disruption and constructed a mutant mainly producing carbamoyltobramycin. The generation of antibiotics is significantly affected by the secondary metabolism of actinomycetes which could be controlled by modifying the pathway-specific regulatory proteins within the cluster. Within the tobramycin biosynthesis cluster, a transcriptional regulatory factor TobR belonging to the Lrp/AsnC family was identified. Based on the sequence and structural characteristics, tobR might encode a pathway-specific transcriptional regulatory factor during biosynthesis. Knockout and overexpression strains of tobR were constructed to investigate its role in carbamoyltobramycin production. Results showed that knockout of TobR increased carbamoyltobramycin biosynthesis by 22.35%, whereas its overexpression decreased carbamoyltobramycin production by 10.23%. In vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments confirmed that TobR interacts with DNA at the adjacent tobO promoter position. Strains overexpressing tobO with ermEp* promoter exhibited 36.36% increase, and tobO with kasOp* promoter exhibited 22.84% increase in carbamoyltobramycin titer. When the overexpressing of tobO and the knockout of tobR were combined, the production of carbamoyltobramycin was further enhanced. In the shake-flask fermentation, the titer reached 3.76 g/L, which was 42.42% higher than that of starting strain. Understanding the role of Lrp/AsnC family transcription regulators would be useful for other antibiotic biosynthesis in other actinomycetes. KEY POINTS: • The transcriptional regulator TobR belonging to the Lrp/AsnC family was identified.  • An oxygenase TobO was identified within the tobramycin biosynthesis cluster. • TobO and TobR have significant effects on the synthesis of carbamoyltobramycin.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643456/,tobramycin essential extensively used broadspectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic obtained alkaline hydrolysis carbamoyltobramycin one fermentation product streptoalloteichus tenebrarius simplify composition fermentation product industrial strain main byproduct apramycin blocked gene disruption constructed mutant mainly producing carbamoyltobramycin generation antibiotic significantly affected secondary metabolism actinomycete could controlled modifying pathwayspecific regulatory protein within cluster within tobramycin biosynthesis cluster transcriptional regulatory factor tobr belonging lrpasnc family identified based sequence structural characteristic tobr might encode pathwayspecific transcriptional regulatory factor biosynthesis knockout overexpression strain tobr constructed investigate role carbamoyltobramycin production result showed knockout tobr increased carbamoyltobramycin biosynthesis whereas overexpression decreased carbamoyltobramycin production vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay emsa experiment confirmed tobr interacts dna adjacent tobo promoter position strain overexpressing tobo ermep promoter exhibited increase tobo kasop promoter exhibited increase carbamoyltobramycin titer overexpressing tobo knockout tobr combined production carbamoyltobramycin enhanced shakeflask fermentation titer reached gl higher starting strain understanding role lrpasnc family transcription regulator would useful antibiotic biosynthesis actinomycete key point transcriptional regulator tobr belonging lrpasnc family identified oxygenase tobo identified within tobramycin biosynthesis cluster tobo tobr significant effect synthesis carbamoyltobramycin
317,"Kurarinone, a flavonoid from Radix Sophorae Flavescentis, inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in mouse bone marrow-derived monocyte/macrophages.","Inflammation-induced osteoclast proliferation is a crucial contributor to impaired bone metabolism. Kurarinone (KR), a flavonoid extracted from the Radix Sophorae Flavescentis, exhibits notable anti-inflammatory properties. Nevertheless, the precise influence of KR on osteoclast formation remains unclear. This study's objective was to assess the impact of KR on osteoclast activity in vitro and unravel its underlying mechanism. Initially, a target network for KR-osteoclastogenesis-osteoporosis was constructed using network pharmacology. Subsequently, the intersecting targets were identified through the Venny platform and a PPI network was created using Cytoscape 3.9.1. Key targets within the network were identified employing topological algorithms. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis were then performed on these targets to explore their specific functions and pathways. Additionally, molecular docking of potential core targets of KR was conducted, and the results were validated through cell experiments. A total of 83 target genes overlapped between KR and osteoclastogenesis-osteoporosis targets. Enrichment analysis revealed their role in inflammatory response, protein tyrosine kinase activity, osteoclast differentiation, and MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. PPI analysis and molecular docking demonstrate that key targets MAPK14 and MAPK8 exhibit more stable binding with KR compared to other proteins. In vitro experiments demonstrate that KR effectively inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption without cellular toxicity. It suppresses key osteoclast genes (NFATc1, c-Fos, TRAP, MMP9, Ctsk, Atp6v2), hinders IκB-α degradation, and inhibits ERK and JNK phosphorylation, while not affecting p38 phosphorylation. The results indicate that KR may inhibit osteoclast maturation and bone resorption by blocking NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways, suggesting its potential as a natural therapeutic agent for osteoporosis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643449/,inflammationinduced osteoclast proliferation crucial contributor impaired bone metabolism kurarinone kr flavonoid extracted radix sophorae flavescentis exhibit notable antiinflammatory property nevertheless precise influence kr osteoclast formation remains unclear study objective ass impact kr osteoclast activity vitro unravel underlying mechanism initially target network krosteoclastogenesisosteoporosis constructed using network pharmacology subsequently intersecting target identified venny platform ppi network created using cytoscape key target within network identified employing topological algorithm go enrichment kegg pathway analysis performed target explore specific function pathway additionally molecular docking potential core target kr conducted result validated cell experiment total target gene overlapped kr osteoclastogenesisosteoporosis target enrichment analysis revealed role inflammatory response protein tyrosine kinase activity osteoclast differentiation mapk nfb signaling pathway ppi analysis molecular docking demonstrate key target mapk mapk exhibit stable binding kr compared protein vitro experiment demonstrate kr effectively inhibits osteoclast differentiation bone resorption without cellular toxicity suppresses key osteoclast gene nfatc cfo trap mmp ctsk atpv hinders ib degradation inhibits erk jnk phosphorylation affecting p phosphorylation result indicate kr may inhibit osteoclast maturation bone resorption blocking nfb mapk signaling pathway suggesting potential natural therapeutic agent osteoporosis
318,Adipose-derived stem cells promote glycolysis and peritoneal metastasis via TGF-β1/SMAD3/ANGPTL4 axis in colorectal cancer.,"Peritoneal metastasis, the third most common metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC), has a poor prognosis for the rapid progression and limited therapeutic strategy. However, the molecular characteristics and pathogenesis of CRC peritoneal metastasis are poorly understood. Here, we aimed to elucidate the action and mechanism of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), a prominent component of the peritoneal microenvironment, in CRC peritoneal metastasis formation. Database analysis indicated that ADSCs infiltration was increased in CRC peritoneal metastases, and high expression levels of ADSCs marker genes predicted a poor prognosis. Then we investigated the effect of ADSCs on CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. The results revealed that CRC cells co-cultured with ADSCs exhibited stronger metastatic property and anoikis resistance, and ADSCs boosted the intraperitoneal seeding of CRC cells. Furthermore, RNA sequencing was carried out to identify the key target gene, angiopoietin like 4 (ANGPTL4), which was upregulated in CRC specimens, especially in peritoneal metastases. Mechanistically, TGF-β1 secreted by ADSCs activated SMAD3 in CRC cells, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that SMAD3 facilitated ANGPTL4 transcription by directly binding to ANGPTL4 promoter. The ANGPTL4 upregulation was essential for ADSCs to promote glycolysis and anoikis resistance in CRC. Importantly, simultaneously targeting TGF-β signaling and ANGPTL4 efficiently reduced intraperitoneal seeding in vivo. In conclusion, this study indicates that tumor-infiltrating ADSCs promote glycolysis and anoikis resistance in CRC cells and ultimately facilitate peritoneal metastasis via the TGF-β1/SMAD3/ANGPTL4 axis. The dual-targeting of TGF-β signaling and ANGPTL4 may be a feasible therapeutic strategy for CRC peritoneal metastasis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643448/,peritoneal metastasis third common metastasis colorectal cancer crc poor prognosis rapid progression limited therapeutic strategy however molecular characteristic pathogenesis crc peritoneal metastasis poorly understood aimed elucidate action mechanism adiposederived stem cell adscs prominent component peritoneal microenvironment crc peritoneal metastasis formation database analysis indicated adscs infiltration increased crc peritoneal metastasis high expression level adscs marker gene predicted poor prognosis investigated effect adscs crc cell vitro vivo result revealed crc cell cocultured adscs exhibited stronger metastatic property anoikis resistance adscs boosted intraperitoneal seeding crc cell furthermore rna sequencing carried identify key target gene angiopoietin like angptl upregulated crc specimen especially peritoneal metastasis mechanistically tgf secreted adscs activated smad crc cell chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed smad facilitated angptl transcription directly binding angptl promoter angptl upregulation essential adscs promote glycolysis anoikis resistance crc importantly simultaneously targeting tgf signaling angptl efficiently reduced intraperitoneal seeding vivo conclusion study indicates tumorinfiltrating adscs promote glycolysis anoikis resistance crc cell ultimately facilitate peritoneal metastasis via tgfsmadangptl axis dualtargeting tgf signaling angptl may feasible therapeutic strategy crc peritoneal metastasis

Post-fertilization eggs were exposed to increasing concentrations of the drugs for six days. The expression levels of two genetic biomarkers for toxicity and four thyroid hormone-related gene pathways were measured. Interestingly, the results showed that all concentrations of the five cytostatics affect the transcription levels of both toxicity biomarker genes. Additionally, the thyroid hormone-related genes had different expression levels than the control, with the most significant changes observed in those larvae exposed to cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide.

322,Absence of E2f1 Negates Pro-osteogenic Impacts of p21 Absence.,"Loss of p21 leads to increased bone formation post-injury; however, the mechanism(s) by which this occurs remains undetermined. E2f1 is downstream of p21 and as a transcription factor can act directly on gene expression; yet it is unknown if E2f1 plays a role in the osteogenic effects observed when p21 is differentially regulated. In this study we aimed to investigate the interplay between p21 and E2f1 and determine if the pro-regenerative osteogenic effects observed with the loss of p21 are E2f1 dependent. To accomplish this, we employed knockout p21 and E2f1 mice and additionally generated a p21/E2f1 double knockout. These mice underwent burr-hole injuries to their proximal tibiae and healing was assessed over 7 days via microCT imaging. We found that p21 and E2f1 play distinct roles in bone regeneration where the loss of p21 increased trabecular bone formation and loss of E2f1 increased cortical bone formation, yet loss of E2f1 led to poorer bone repair overall. Furthermore, when E2f1 was absent, either individually or simultaneously with p21, there was a dramatic decrease of the number of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and chondrocytes at the site of injury compared to p21",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643416/,loss p lead increased bone formation postinjury however mechanism occurs remains undetermined ef downstream p transcription factor act directly gene expression yet unknown ef play role osteogenic effect observed p differentially regulated study aimed investigate interplay p ef determine proregenerative osteogenic effect observed loss p ef dependent accomplish employed knockout p ef mouse additionally generated pef double knockout mouse underwent burrhole injury proximal tibia healing assessed day via microct imaging found p ef play distinct role bone regeneration loss p increased trabecular bone formation loss ef increased cortical bone formation yet loss ef led poorer bone repair overall furthermore ef absent either individually simultaneously p dramatic decrease number osteoblast osteoclast chondrocytes site injury compared p

326,Navigating therapeutic strategies: HPV classification in head and neck cancer.,"The World Health Organisation recognised human papillomavirus (HPV) as the cause of multiple cancers, including head and neck cancers. HPV is a double-stranded DNA virus, and its viral gene expression can be controlled after infection by cellular and viral promoters. In cancer cells, the HPV genome is detected as either integrated into the host genome, episomal (extrachromosomal), or a mixture of integrated and episomal. Viral integration requires the breakage of both viral and host DNA, and the integration rate correlates with the level of DNA damage. Interestingly, patients with HPV-positive head and neck cancers generally have a good prognosis except for a group of patients with fully integrated HPV who show worst clinical outcomes. Those patients present with lowered expression of viral genes and limited infiltration of cytotoxic T cells. An impediment to effective therapy applications in the clinic is the sole testing for HPV positivity without considering the HPV integration status. This review will discuss HPV integration as a potential determinant of response to therapies in head and neck cancers and highlight to the field a novel therapeutic avenue that would reduce the cancer burden and improve patient survival.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643337/,world health organisation recognised human papillomavirus hpv cause multiple cancer including head neck cancer hpv doublestranded dna virus viral gene expression controlled infection cellular viral promoter cancer cell hpv genome detected either integrated host genome episomal extrachromosomal mixture integrated episomal viral integration requires breakage viral host dna integration rate correlate level dna damage interestingly patient hpvpositive head neck cancer generally good prognosis except group patient fully integrated hpv show worst clinical outcome patient present lowered expression viral gene limited infiltration cytotoxic cell impediment effective therapy application clinic sole testing hpv positivity without considering hpv integration status review discus hpv integration potential determinant response therapy head neck cancer highlight field novel therapeutic avenue would reduce cancer burden improve patient survival
327,Peanut LEAFY COTYLEDON1-type genes participate in regulating the embryo development and the accumulation of storage lipids.,"Two peanut LEC1-type genes exhibit partial functional redundancy. AhNFYB10 could complement almost all the defective phenotypes of lec1-2 in terms of embryonic morphology, while AhNF-YB1 could partially affect these phenotypes. LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) is a member of the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) family of transcription factors and has been identified as a key regulator of embryonic development. In the present study, two LEC1-type genes from Arachis hypogeae were identified and designated as AhNF-YB1 and AhNF-YB10; these genes belong to subgenome A and subgenome B, respectively. The functions of AhNF-YB1 and AhNF-YB10 were investigated by complementation analysis of their defective phenotypes of the Arabidopsis lec1-2 mutant and by ectopic expression in wild-type Arabidopsis. The results indicated that both AhNF-YB1 and AhNF-YB10 participate in regulating embryogenesis, embryo development, and reserve deposition in cotyledons and that they have partial functional redundancy. In contrast, AhNF-YB10 complemented almost all the defective phenotypes of lec1-2 in terms of embryonic morphology and hypocotyl length, while AhNF-YB1 had only a partial effect. In addition, 30-40% of the seeds of the AhNF-YB1 transformants exhibited a decreasing germination ratio and longevity. Therefore, appropriate spatiotemporal expression of these genes is necessary for embryo morphogenesis at the early development stage and is responsible for seed maturation at the mid-late development stage. On the other hand, overexpression of AhNF-YB1 or AhNF-YB10 at the middle to late stages of Arabidopsis seed development improved the weight, oil content, and fatty acid composition of the transgenic seeds. Moreover, the expression levels of several genes associated with fatty acid synthesis and embryogenesis were significantly greater in developing AhNF-YB10-overexpressing seeds than in control seeds.

328,Haemostatic gene variations in cervical cancer-associated venous thrombosis: considerations for clinical strategies.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a life-threatening haemostatic disease frequently diagnosed among the cancer population. The Khorana Score is currently the primal risk assessment model to stratify oncological patients according to their susceptibility to VTE, however, it displays a limited performance. Meanwhile, intensive research on VTE pathophysiology in the general population has uncovered a range of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the condition. Nonetheless, their predictive ability concerning cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) is controversial. Cervical cancer (CC) patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy often experience VTE, which negatively affects their survival. Thus, aiming for an improvement in thromboprophylaxis, new thrombotic biomarkers, including SNPs, are currently under investigation. In this study, the predictive capability of haemostatic gene SNPs on CC-related VTE and their prognostic value regardless of VTE were explored. Six SNPs in haemostatic genes were evaluated. A total of 401 CC patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy were enrolled in a retrospective cohort study. The implications for the time to VTE occurrence and overall survival (OS) were assessed. CAT considerably impacted the CC patients' OS (log-rank test, P < 0.001). SERPINE1 rs2070682 (T > C) showed a significant association with the risk of CC-related VTE (CC/CT vs. TT, log-rank test, P = 0.002; C allele, Cox model, hazard ratio (HR) = 6.99 and P = 0.009), while F2 rs1799963 (G > A) demonstrated an important prognostic value regardless of VTE (AA/AG vs. GG, log-rank test, P = 0.020; A allele, Cox model, HR = 2.76 and P = 0.026). For the remaining SNPs, no significant associations were detected.

331,8-Cl-Ado and 8-NH,"Targeting the metabolic dependencies of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells is a promising therapeutical strategy. In particular, the cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway (C/M) is significantly altered in AML cells compared to healthy blood cells. Moreover, methionine has been identified as one of the dominant amino acid dependencies of AML cells. Through RNA-seq, we found that the two nucleoside analogs 8-chloro-adenosine (8CA) and 8-amino-adenosine (8AA) significantly suppress the C/M pathway in AML cells, and methionine-adenosyltransferase-2A (MAT2A) is one of most significantly downregulated genes. Additionally, mass spectrometry analysis revealed that Venetoclax (VEN), a BCL-2 inhibitor recently approved by the FDA for AML treatment, significantly decreases the intracellular level of methionine in AML cells. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that combining 8CA or 8AA with VEN can efficiently target the Methionine-MAT2A-S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) axis in AML. Our results demonstrate that VEN and 8CA/8AA synergistically decrease the SAM biosynthesis and effectively target AML cells both in vivo and in vitro.

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) influence various tumor outcomes. However, NET-related genes (NRGs) in AML had not yet received much attention. This study focuses on the role of NRGs in AML and their interaction with the immunological microenvironment. The gene expression and clinical data of patients with AML were downloaded from the TCGA-LAML and GEO cohorts. We identified 148 NRGs through the published article. Univariate Cox regression was used to analyze the association of NRGs with overall survival (OS). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were utilized to assess the predictive efficacy of NRGs. Kaplan-Meier plots visualized survival estimates. ROC curves assessed the prognostic value of NRG-based features. A nomogram, integrating clinical information and prognostic scores of patients, was constructed using multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression models. Twenty-seven NRGs were found to significantly impact patient OS. Six NRGs-CFTR, ENO1, PARVB, DDIT4, MPO, LDLR-were notable for their strong predictive ability regarding patient survival. The ROC values for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 0.794, 0.781, and 0.911, respectively. In the training set (TCGA-LAML), patients in the high NRG risk group showed a poorer prognosis (p < 0.001), which was validated in two external datasets (GSE71014 and GSE106291). The 6-NRG signature and corresponding nomograms exhibit superior predictive accuracy, offering insights for pre-immune response evaluation and guiding future immuno-oncology treatments and drug selection for AML patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643300/,acute myeloid leukemia aml malignant blood cancer high mortality rate neutrophil extracellular trap net influence various tumor outcome however netrelated gene nrgs aml yet received much attention study focus role nrgs aml interaction immunological microenvironment gene expression clinical data patient aml downloaded tcgalaml geo cohort identified nrgs published article univariate cox regression used analyze association nrgs overall survival o least absolute shrinkage selection operator utilized ass predictive efficacy nrgs kaplanmeier plot visualized survival estimate roc curve assessed prognostic value nrgbased feature nomogram integrating clinical information prognostic score patient constructed using multivariate logistic regression cox proportional hazard regression model twentyseven nrgs found significantly impact patient o six nrgscftr eno parvb ddit mpo ldlrwere notable strong predictive ability regarding patient survival roc value year survival rate respectively training set tcgalaml patient high nrg risk group showed poorer prognosis p validated two external datasets gse gse nrg signature corresponding nomogram exhibit superior predictive accuracy offering insight preimmune response evaluation guiding future immunooncology treatment drug selection aml patient

S. tropicum is a high temperature preferring species thriving in tropical ocean regions or temperate ocean regions during summer-autumn. However, mechanisms of ecological adaptation of S. tropicum remain poorly understood due partially to the lack of a high-quality whole genome assembly. Here, we report the first high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly for S. tropicum, using cutting-edge technologies including PacBio single molecular sequencing and high-throughput chromatin conformation capture. The assembled genome has a size of 78.78 Mb with a scaffold N50 of 3.17 Mb, anchored to 23 pseudo-chromosomes. In total, 20,613 protein-coding genes were predicted, of which 17,757 (86.14%) genes were functionally annotated. Collinearity analysis of the genomes of S. tropicum and S. marinoi revealed that these two genomes were highly homologous.

335,Spontaneous Akt2 deficiency in a colony of NOD mice exhibiting early diabetes.,"Diabetes constitutes a major public health problem, with dramatic consequences for patients. Both genetic and environmental factors were shown to contribute to the different forms of the disease. The monogenic forms, found both in humans and in animal models, specially help to decipher the role of key genes in the physiopathology of the disease. Here, we describe the phenotype of early diabetes in a colony of NOD mice, with spontaneous invalidation of Akt2, that we called HYP. The HYP mice were characterised by a strong and chronic hyperglycaemia, beginning around the age of one month, especially in male mice. The phenotype was not the consequence of the acceleration of the autoimmune response, inherent to the NOD background. Interestingly, in HYP mice, we observed hyperinsulinemia before hyperglycaemia occurred. We did not find any difference in the pancreas' architecture of the NOD and HYP mice (islets' size and staining for insulin and glucagon) but we detected a lower insulin content in the pancreas of HYP mice compared to NOD mice. These results give new insights about the role played by Akt2 in glucose homeostasis and argue for the ß cell failure being the primary event in the course of diabetes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643275/,diabetes constitutes major public health problem dramatic consequence patient genetic environmental factor shown contribute different form disease monogenic form found human animal model specially help decipher role key gene physiopathology disease describe phenotype early diabetes colony nod mouse spontaneous invalidation akt called hyp hyp mouse characterised strong chronic hyperglycaemia beginning around age one month especially male mouse phenotype consequence acceleration autoimmune response inherent nod background interestingly hyp mouse observed hyperinsulinemia hyperglycaemia occurred find difference pancreas architecture nod hyp mouse islet size staining insulin glucagon detected lower insulin content pancreas hyp mouse compared nod mouse result give new insight role played akt glucose homeostasis argue cell failure primary event course diabetes
336,Integrative analysis in head and neck cancer reveals distinct role of miRNome and methylome as tumour epigenetic drivers.,"Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide, with the relatively low 5-year survival rate, mainly because it is diagnosed at a late stage. Infection with HPV is a well known aetiology, which affects the nature of these cancers and patients' survival. Besides, it is considered that the main driving force for this type of cancer could be epigenetics. In this study we aimed to find potential epigenetic biomarkers, by integrating miRNome, methylome, and transcriptome analyses. From the fresh head and neck cancer tissue samples, we chose a group for miRNome, methylome and transcriptome profiling, in comparison to adequate control samples. Bioinformatics analyses are performed in R v4.2.2. Count normalisation and group differential expression for mRNA and the previously obtained miRNA count data was performed with DESeq2 v1.36. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed and visualised using gProfiler2 v0.2.1 Identification of miRNA targets was performed by querying in miRTarBase using multiMiR v1.18.0. Annotation of CpG sites merging into islands was obtained from RnBeads.hg19 v1.28.0. package. For the integrative analysis we performed kmeans clustering using stats v4.2.2 package, using 8-12 clusters and nstart 100. We found that transcriptome analysis divides samples into cancers and controls clusters, with no relation to HPV status or cancer anatomical location. Differentially expressed genes (n = 2781) were predominantly associated with signalling pathways of tumour progression. We identified a cluster of genes under the control of the transcription factor E2F that are significantly underexpressed in cancer tissue, as well as T cell immunity genes and genes related to regulation of transcription. Among overexpressed genes in tumours we found those that belong to cell cycle regulation and vasculature. A small number of genes were found significantly differentially expressed in HPV-positive versus HPV-negative tumours (for example NEFH, ZFR2, TAF7L, ZNF541, and TYMS). In this comprehensive study on an overlapping set of samples where the integration of miRNome, methylome and transcriptome analysis were performed for head and neck cancer, we demonstrated that the majority of genes were associated exclusively with miRNome or methylome and, to a lesser extent, under the control of both epigenetic mechanisms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643268/,head neck cancer sixth common malignancy worldwide relatively low year survival rate mainly diagnosed late stage infection hpv well known aetiology affect nature cancer patient survival besides considered main driving force type cancer could epigenetics study aimed find potential epigenetic biomarkers integrating mirnome methylome transcriptome analysis fresh head neck cancer tissue sample chose group mirnome methylome transcriptome profiling comparison adequate control sample bioinformatics analysis performed r v count normalisation group differential expression mrna previously obtained mirna count data performed deseq v gene set enrichment analysis performed visualised using gprofiler v identification mirna target performed querying mirtarbase using multimir v annotation cpg site merging island obtained rnbeadshg v package integrative analysis performed kmeans clustering using stats v package using cluster nstart found transcriptome analysis divide sample cancer control cluster relation hpv status cancer anatomical location differentially expressed gene n predominantly associated signalling pathway tumour progression identified cluster gene control transcription factor ef significantly underexpressed cancer tissue well cell immunity gene gene related regulation transcription among overexpressed gene tumour found belong cell cycle regulation vasculature small number gene found significantly differentially expressed hpvpositive versus hpvnegative tumour example nefh zfr tafl znf tyms comprehensive study overlapping set sample integration mirnome methylome transcriptome analysis performed head neck cancer demonstrated majority gene associated exclusively mirnome methylome lesser extent control epigenetic mechanism

339,Alfalfa xeno-miR159a regulates bovine mammary epithelial cell proliferation and milk protein synthesis by targeting PTPRF.,"Milk protein content is an important index to evaluate the quality and nutrition of milk. Accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in bovine lactation, but little is known regarding the cross-kingdom regulatory roles of plant-derived exogenous miRNAs (xeno-miRNAs) in milk protein synthesis, particularly the underlying molecular mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to explore the regulatory mechanism of alfalfa-derived xeno-miRNAs on proliferation and milk protein synthesis in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs). Our previous study showed that alfalfa miR159a (mtr-miR159a, xeno-miR159a) was highly expressed in alfalfa, and the abundance of mtr-miR159a was significantly lower in serum and whey from high-protein-milk dairy cows compared with low-protein-milk dairy cows. In this study, mRNA expression was detected by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), and casein content was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected using the cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining, western blot, and flow cytometry. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to determine the regulation of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type F (PTPRF) by xeno-miR159a. We found that xeno-miR159a overexpression inhibited proliferation of BMEC and promoted cell apoptosis. Besides, xeno-miR159a overexpression decreased β-casein abundance, and increased α-casein and κ-casein abundance in BMECs. Dual-luciferase reporter assay result confirmed that PTPRF is a target gene of xeno-miR159a.

340,Detection and genomic characterization of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli harboring tet(X4) in black kites (Milvus migrans) in Pakistan.,"The emergence of plasmid-mediated tigecycline resistance gene tet(X4) among clinically relevant bacteria has promoted significant concerns, as tigecycline is considered a last-resort drug against serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. We herein focused on the isolation and molecular characterization of tet(X4)-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) in wild bird populations with anthropogenic interaction in Faisalabad, Pakistan. A total of 150 birds including black kites (Milvus migrans) and house crows (Corvus splendens) were screened for the presence of tigecycline resistance K. pneumoniae and E. coli. We found two K. pneumoniae and one E. coli isolate carrying tet(X4) originating from black kites. A combination of short- and long-read sequencing strategies showed that tet(X4) was located on a broad host range IncFII plasmid family in K. pneumoniae isolates whereas on an IncFII-IncFIB hybrid plasmid in E. coli. We also found an integrative and conjugative element ICEKp2 in K. pneumoniae isolate KP8336. We demonstrate the first description of tet(X4) gene in the WHO critical-priority pathogen K. pneumoniae among wild birds. The convergence of tet(X4) and virulence associated ICEKp2 in a wild bird with known anthropogenic contact should be further investigated to evaluate the potential epidemiological implications. The potential risk of global transmission of tet(X4)-positive K. pneumoniae and E. coli warrant comprehensive evaluation and emphasizes the need for effective mitigation strategies to reduce anthropogenic-driven dissemination of AMR in the environment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643223/,emergence plasmidmediated tigecycline resistance gene tetx among clinically relevant bacteria promoted significant concern tigecycline considered lastresort drug serious infection caused multidrugresistant bacteria herein focused isolation molecular characterization tetxpositive klebsiella pneumoniae k pneumoniae escherichia coli e coli wild bird population anthropogenic interaction faisalabad pakistan total bird including black kite milvus migrans house crow corvus splendens screened presence tigecycline resistance k pneumoniae e coli found two k pneumoniae one e coli isolate carrying tetx originating black kite combination short longread sequencing strategy showed tetx located broad host range incfii plasmid family k pneumoniae isolates whereas incfiiincfib hybrid plasmid e coli also found integrative conjugative element icekp k pneumoniae isolate kp demonstrate first description tetx gene criticalpriority pathogen k pneumoniae among wild bird convergence tetx virulence associated icekp wild bird known anthropogenic contact investigated evaluate potential epidemiological implication potential risk global transmission tetxpositive k pneumoniae e coli warrant comprehensive evaluation emphasizes need effective mitigation strategy reduce anthropogenicdriven dissemination amr environment

342,"The overlooked evolutionary dynamics of 16S rRNA revises its role as the ""gold standard"" for bacterial species identification.","The role of 16S rRNA has been and largely remains crucial for the identification of microbial organisms. Although 16S rRNA could certainly be described as one of the most studied sequences ever, the current view of it remains somewhat ambiguous. While some consider 16S rRNA to be a variable marker with resolution power down to the strain level, others consider them to be living fossils that carry information about the origin of domains of cellular life. We show that 16S rRNA is clearly an evolutionarily very rigid sequence, making it a largely unique and irreplaceable marker, but its applicability beyond the genus level is highly limited. Interestingly, it seems that the evolutionary rigidity is not driven by functional constraints of the sequence (RNA-protein interactions), but rather results from the characteristics of the host organism. Our results suggest that, at least in some lineages, Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) within genera plays an important role for the evolutionary non-dynamics (stasis) of 16S rRNA. Such genera exhibit an apparent lack of diversification at the 16S rRNA level in comparison to the rest of a genome.

Mucosal biopsies of the descending duodenum were collected. Five regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified and sequenced. Other assessments conducted on the study subjects included body mass index, transient elastography, liver enzymes, and lipid profile. Fifty-one subjects (36 with MASLD and 15 controls) were evaluated. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding alpha- or beta-diversity of the duodenal mucosal microbiota. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis showed that the genera Serratia and Aggregatibacter were more abundant in the duodenal mucosa of patients with MASLD, whereas the duodenal mucosal microbiota of the healthy controls was enriched with the genus Petrobacter. PICRUSt2 analysis revealed that genes associated with amino acid degradation and carboxylate degradation were significantly enriched in the duodenal mucosal microbiota of patients with MASLD.

However, little attention has been paid to the functional roles of the involved secretory pathway in the high-level production of cellulases in T. reesei. Rab GTPases are key regulators in coordinating various vesicle trafficking associated with the eukaryotic secretory pathway. Specifically, Rab7 is a representative GTPase regulating the transition of the early endosome to the late endosome followed by its fusion to the vacuole as well as homotypic vacuole fusion.

347,N4BP1 functions as a dimerization-dependent linear ubiquitin reader which regulates TNF signalling.,"Signalling through TNFR1 modulates proinflammatory gene transcription and programmed cell death, and its impairment causes autoimmune diseases and cancer. NEDD4-binding protein 1 (N4BP1) is a critical suppressor of proinflammatory cytokine production that acts as a regulator of innate immune signalling and inflammation. However, our current understanding about the molecular properties that enable N4BP1 to exert its suppressive potential remain limited. Here, we show that N4BP1 is a novel linear ubiquitin reader that negatively regulates NFκB signalling by its unique dimerization-dependent ubiquitin-binding module that we named LUBIN. Dimeric N4BP1 strategically positions two non-selective ubiquitin-binding domains to ensure preferential recognition of linear ubiquitin. Under proinflammatory conditions, N4BP1 is recruited to the nascent TNFR1 signalling complex, where it regulates duration of proinflammatory signalling in LUBIN-dependent manner. N4BP1 deficiency accelerates TNFα-induced cell death by increasing complex II assembly. Under proapoptotic conditions, caspase-8 mediates proteolytic processing of N4BP1, resulting in rapid degradation of N4BP1 by the 26 S proteasome, and acceleration of apoptosis. In summary, our findings demonstrate that N4BP1 dimerization creates a novel type of ubiquitin reader that selectively recognises linear ubiquitin which enables the timely and coordinated regulation of TNFR1-mediated inflammation and cell death.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38643192/,signalling tnfr modulates proinflammatory gene transcription programmed cell death impairment cause autoimmune disease cancer neddbinding protein nbp critical suppressor proinflammatory cytokine production act regulator innate immune signalling inflammation however current understanding molecular property enable nbp exert suppressive potential remain limited show nbp novel linear ubiquitin reader negatively regulates nfb signalling unique dimerizationdependent ubiquitinbinding module named lubin dimeric nbp strategically position two nonselective ubiquitinbinding domain ensure preferential recognition linear ubiquitin proinflammatory condition nbp recruited nascent tnfr signalling complex regulates duration proinflammatory signalling lubindependent manner nbp deficiency accelerates tnfinduced cell death increasing complex ii assembly proapoptotic condition caspase mediates proteolytic processing nbp resulting rapid degradation nbp proteasome acceleration apoptosis summary finding demonstrate nbp dimerization creates novel type ubiquitin reader selectively recognises linear ubiquitin enables timely coordinated regulation tnfrmediated inflammation cell death

Here, we identify 7 families presenting a new cardiac entity associated with a heterozygous deletion of 2 CTCF binding sites on 4q25, inducing TAD fusion and chromatin conformation remodeling. The CTCF binding sites are located in a gene desert at 1 Mb from the Paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 gene (PITX2). By introducing the ortholog of the human deletion in the mouse genome, we recapitulate the patient phenotype and characterize an opposite dysregulation of PITX2 expression in the sinoatrial node (ectopic activation) and ventricle (reduction), respectively. Chromatin conformation assay performed in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes harboring the minimal deletion identified in family#1 reveals a conformation remodeling and fusion of TADs.

356,A novel variant in NSUN2 causes intellectual disability in a Chinese family.,"NSUN2-intellectual disability syndrome, also known as intellectual disability type 5 (MRT5), is an autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by intellectual disability (ID), postnatal growth retardation, dysmorphic facies, microcephaly, short stature, developmental delay, language impairment and other congenital abnormalities. The disease is caused by mutations in the NSUN2 gene, which encodes a tRNA cytosine methyltransferase that has an important role in spindle assembly during mitosis and chromosome segregation. In this study, we recruited a family that had two individuals with ID. Whole exome sequencing was performed to identify a homozygous frameshift variant (c.1171_1175delACCAT(p.Thr391fs*18*)) in NSUN2 (NM_017755.5) in the proband. The varint was confirmed as segregating in his affected brother and his parents by Sanger sequencing. The individuals that we described showed a similar dysmorphology profile to that associated with MRT5. To analyze the correlations between genotypes of NSUN2 and phenotypes of individuals with ID, we examined 17 variants and the associated phenotypes from 32 ID individuals in current and previous studies. We concluded that mutations in NSUN2 cause a wide range of phenotypic defects. Although some clinical manifestations were highly variable, the core phenotypes associated with NSUN2 mutations were dysmorphic facies, microcephaly, short stature, ID, growth restriction, language impairment, hypotonia and delayed puberty.

368,Impact of the inaccessible genome on genotype imputation and genome-wide association studies.,"Genotype imputation is widely used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, both the genotyping chips and imputation reference panels are dependent on next-generation sequencing (NGS). Due to the nature of NGS, some regions of the genome are inaccessible to sequencing. To date, there has been no complete evaluation of these regions and their impact on the identification of associations in GWAS remains unclear. In this study, we systematically assess the extent to which variants in inaccessible regions are underrepresented on genotyping chips and imputation reference panels, in GWAS results and in variant databases. We also determine the proportion of genes located in inaccessible regions and compare the results across variant masks defined by the 1000 Genomes Project and the TOPMed program. Overall, fewer variants were observed in inaccessible regions in all categories analyzed. Depending on the mask used and normalized for region size, only 4%-17% of the genotyped variants are located in inaccessible regions and 52 to 581 genes were almost completely inaccessible. From the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study, we present a case study of an association located in an inaccessible region that is driven by genotyped variants and cannot be reproduced by imputation in GRCh37. We conclude that genotyping, NGS, genotype imputation and downstream analyses such as GWAS and fine mapping are systematically biased in inaccessible regions, due to missed variants and spurious associations.

Enhancers regulate cell-type-specific transcription of tRNA genes by RNA polymerase III (Pol III). They are also responsible for the binding of the origin replication complex (ORC) to DNA replication origins, thereby regulating origin utilization, replication timing, and replication-dependent chromosome breaks. Additionally, enhancers regulate V(D)J recombination by increasing access of the recombination-activating gene (RAG) recombinase to target sites and by generating non-coding enhancer RNAs and localized regions of trimethylated histone H3-K4 recognized by the RAG2 PHD domain.

371,Expression of an endo-rhamnogalacturonase from Aspergillus aculeatus enhances release of Arabidopsis transparent mucilage.,"Mucilage is a gelatinous and sticky hydrophilic polysaccharide released from epidermal cells of seed coat after the hydration of mature seeds and is composed primarily of unbranched rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I). In this study, we produced a recombinant endo-RG-I hydrolase from Aspergillus aculeatus (AaRhgA) in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and examined its substrate preference for pyridylaminated (PA) RG-I with the various degrees of polymerization (DP). Recombinant AaRhgA requires PA-RG-I with a DP of 10 or higher for its hydrolase activity. We heterologously expressed the AarhgA gene under the strong constitutive promoter, cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, in Arabidopsis thaliana. In a series of biochemical analyses of each mucilage fraction released from the water-imbibed seeds of the transgenic plants, we found the enhanced deposition of the transparent mucilage layer that existed in the peripheral regions of the adherent mucilage and was not stained with ruthenium red.

372,Spatial enrichment and genomic analyses reveal the link of NOMO1 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe motor neuron disease with uncertain genetic predisposition in most sporadic cases. Spatial architecture of cell types and gene expression is the basis of cell-cell interactions, biological function and disease pathology, but is not well investigated in human motor cortex, a key ALS relevant brain region. Recent studies indicated single nucleus transcriptomic features of motor neuron vulnerability in ALS motor cortex. However, it remains largely unclear what is the brain regional vulnerability of ALS-associated genes, and what is the genetic link between region-specific genes and ALS risk. Here, we developed an entropy-weighted differential gene expression matrix-based tool (SpatialE) to identify the spatial enrichment of gene sets in spatial transcriptomics (ST). We benchmarked SpatialE against another enrichment tool (Multimodal Intersection Analysis, MIA) using ST data from both human and mouse brain tissues. To investigate regional vulnerability, we analyzed three human motor cortex and two dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues for spatial enrichment of ALS-associated genes. We also used Cell2location to estimate the abundance of cell types in ALS-related cortex layers. To dissect the link of regionally expressed genes and ALS risk, we performed burden analyses of rare loss-of-function (LOF) variants detected by whole-genome sequencing in ALS patients and controls, and then analyzed differential gene expression in the TargetALS RNA-seq dataset. SpatialE showed more accurate and specific spatial enrichment of regional cell type markers than MIA in both mouse brain and human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Spatial transcriptomic analyses of human motor cortex showed heterogenous cell types and spatial gene expression profiles. We found that 260 manually curated ALS-associated genes are significantly enriched in layer 5 (L5) motor cortex, with abundant expression of upper motor neurons and L5 excitatory neurons. Burden analyses of rare LOF variants in L5-associated genes nominated NOMO1 as a novel ALS-associated gene in a combined sample set of 6,814 ALS patients and 3,324 controls (P = 0.029). Gene expression analyses in central nervous system tissues revealed down-regulation of NOMO1 in ALS, which is consistent with a LOF disease mechanism.

376,Binding evolution of the Dengue Virus Envelope against DC-SIGN: A combined approach of phylogenetics and molecular dynamics analyses over 30 years of Dengue Virus in Brazil.,"The Red Queen Hypothesis (RQH), derived from Lewis Carroll's ""Through the Looking-Glass"", postulates that organisms must continually adapt in response to each other to maintain relative fitness. Within the context of host-pathogen interactions, the RQH implies an evolutionary arms race, wherein viruses evolve to exploit hosts and hosts evolve to resist viral invasion. This study delves into the dynamics of the RQH in the context of virus-cell interactions, specifically focusing on virus receptors and cell receptors. We observed multiple virus-host systems and noted patterns of co-evolution. As viruses evolved receptor-binding proteins to effectively engage with cell receptors, cells countered by altering their receptor genes. This ongoing mutual adaptation cycle has influenced the molecular intricacies of receptor-ligand interactions. Our data supports the RQH as a driving force behind the diversification and specialization of both viral and host cell receptors. Understanding this co-evolutionary dance offers insights into the unpredictability of emerging viral diseases and potential therapeutic interventions. Future research is crucial to dissect the nuanced molecular changes and the broader ecological consequences of this ever-evolving battle. Here, we combine phylogenetic inferences, structural modeling, and molecular dynamics analyses to describe the epidemiological characteristics of major Brazilian DENV strains that circulated from 1990 to 2022 from a combined perspective, thus providing us with a more detailed picture on the dynamics of such interactions over time.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642883/,red queen hypothesis rqh derived lewis carroll lookingglass postulate organism must continually adapt response maintain relative fitness within context hostpathogen interaction rqh implies evolutionary arm race wherein virus evolve exploit host host evolve resist viral invasion study delf dynamic rqh context viruscell interaction specifically focusing virus receptor cell receptor observed multiple virushost system noted pattern coevolution virus evolved receptorbinding protein effectively engage cell receptor cell countered altering receptor gene ongoing mutual adaptation cycle influenced molecular intricacy receptorligand interaction data support rqh driving force behind diversification specialization viral host cell receptor understanding coevolutionary dance offer insight unpredictability emerging viral disease potential therapeutic intervention future research crucial dissect nuanced molecular change broader ecological consequence everevolving battle combine phylogenetic inference structural modeling molecular dynamic analysis describe epidemiological characteristic major brazilian denv strain circulated combined perspective thus providing u detailed picture dynamic interaction time
377,The alternative enzymes-bearing tunicates lack multiple widely distributed genes coding for peripheral OXPHOS subunits.,"The respiratory chain alternative enzymes (AEs) NDX and AOX from the tunicate Ciona intestinalis (Ascidiacea) have been xenotopically expressed and characterized in human cells in culture and in the model organisms Drosophila melanogaster and mouse, with the purpose of developing bypass therapies to combat mitochondrial diseases in human patients with defective complexes I and III/IV, respectively. The fact that the genes coding for NDX and AOX have been lost from genomes of evolutionarily successful animal groups, such as vertebrates and insects, led us to investigate if the composition of the respiratory chain of Ciona and other tunicates differs significantly from that of humans and Drosophila, to accommodate the natural presence of AEs. We have failed to identify in tunicate genomes fifteen orthologous genes that code for subunits of the respiratory chain complexes; all of these putatively missing subunits are peripheral to complexes I, III and IV in mammals, and many are important for complex-complex interaction in supercomplexes (SCs), such as NDUFA11, UQCR11 and COX7A. Modeling of all respiratory chain subunit polypeptides of Ciona indicates significant structural divergence that is consistent with the lack of these fifteen clear orthologous subunits. We also provide evidence using Ciona AOX expressed in Drosophila that this AE cannot access the coenzyme Q pool reduced by complex I, but it is readily available to oxidize coenzyme Q molecules reduced by glycerophosphate oxidase, a mitochondrial inner membrane-bound dehydrogenase that is not involved in SCs. Altogether, our results suggest that Ciona AEs might have evolved in a mitochondrial inner membrane environment much different from that of mammals and insects, possibly without SCs; this correlates with the preferential functional interaction between these AEs and non-SC dehydrogenases in heterologous mammalian and insect systems. We discuss the implications of these findings for the applicability of Ciona AEs in human bypass therapies and for our understanding of the evolution of animal respiratory chain.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642871/,respiratory chain alternative enzyme aes ndx aox tunicate ciona intestinalis ascidiacea xenotopically expressed characterized human cell culture model organism drosophila melanogaster mouse purpose developing bypass therapy combat mitochondrial disease human patient defective complex iiiiv respectively fact gene coding ndx aox lost genome evolutionarily successful animal group vertebrate insect led u investigate composition respiratory chain ciona tunicate differs significantly human drosophila accommodate natural presence aes failed identify tunicate genome fifteen orthologous gene code subunit respiratory chain complex putatively missing subunit peripheral complex iii iv mammal many important complexcomplex interaction supercomplexes sc ndufa uqcr coxa modeling respiratory chain subunit polypeptide ciona indicates significant structural divergence consistent lack fifteen clear orthologous subunit also provide evidence using ciona aox expressed drosophila ae access coenzyme q pool reduced complex readily available oxidize coenzyme q molecule reduced glycerophosphate oxidase mitochondrial inner membranebound dehydrogenase involved sc altogether result suggest ciona aes might evolved mitochondrial inner membrane environment much different mammal insect possibly without sc correlate preferential functional interaction aes nonsc dehydrogenases heterologous mammalian insect system discus implication finding applicability ciona aes human bypass therapy understanding evolution animal respiratory chain

382,"Intermittent fasting, exercise and dietary modification induce unique transcriptomic signatures of multiple tissues governing metabolic homeostasis during weight loss and rebound weight gain.","Obesity and its related metabolic diseases bring great challenges to public health. In-depth understanding on the efficacy of weight-loss interventions is critical for long-term weight control. Our study demonstrated the comparable efficacy of exercise (EX), intermittent fasting (IF), or the change of daily diet from an unhealthy to a normal chow (DR) for weight reduction, but largely divergently affected metabolic status and transcriptome of subcutaneous fat, scapular brown fat, skeletal muscles and liver in high-fat-high-fructose diet (HFHF) induced obese mice. EX and IF reduced systematic inflammation, improved glucose and lipid metabolism in liver and muscle, and amino acid metabolism and thermogenesis in adipose tissues. EX exhibited broad regulatory effects on TCA cycle, carbon metabolism, thermogenesis, propanoate-, fatty acid and amino acid metabolism across multiple tissues. IF prominently affected genes involved in mitophagy and autophagy in adipose tissues and core genes involved in butanoate metabolism in liver. DR however failed to improve metabolic homeostasis and biological dysfunctions in obese mice. Notably, by exploring potential inter-organ communication, we identified an obesity-resistant-like gene profile that were strongly correlated with HFHF induced metabolic derangements and could predict the degree of weight regain induced by the follow-up HFHF diet. Among them, 12 genes (e.g., Gdf15, Tfrc, Cdv3, Map2k4 and Nqo1) were causally associated with human metabolic traits, i.e., BMI, body fat mass, HbA1C, fasting glucose and cholesterol. Our findings provide critical groundwork for improved understanding the impacts of weight-loss interventions on host metabolism.

384,Advances in nuclear proteostasis of metazoans.,"The proteostasis network and associated protein quality control (PQC) mechanisms ensure proteome functionality and are essential for cell survival. A distinctive feature of eukaryotic cells is their high degree of compartmentalization, requiring specific and adapted proteostasis networks for each compartment. The nucleus, essential for maintaining the integrity of genetic information and gene transcription, is one such compartment. While PQC mechanisms have been investigated for decades in the cytoplasm and the endoplasmic reticulum, our knowledge of nuclear PQC pathways is only emerging. Recent developments in the field have underscored the importance of spatially managing aberrant proteins within the nucleus. Upon proteotoxic stress, misfolded proteins and PQC effectors accumulate in various nuclear membrane-less organelles. Beyond bringing together effectors and substrates, the biophysical properties of these organelles allow novel PQC functions.

Autosomal dominant lamellar ichthyosis (ADLI) is a rare condition, and ASPRV1 was the only gene linked to ADLI to date. We identified a heterozygous variant (ENST00000686631.1:c.1372G>T, p.(Val458Phe)) in the NKPD1 gene in seven individuals from a four-generation German pedigree with generalized lamellar ichthyosis by whole exome sequencing. Segregation analysis confirmed its presence in affected individuals, resulting in a LOD score of 3.31. NKPD1 encodes the NTPase KAP Family P-Loop Domain-Containing Protein 1, implicated in the plasma membrane, its role in human disease is as yet unknown. Skin histology showed moderate acanthosis and compact orthohyperkeratosis, and the ultrastructure differed clearly from that in ASPRV1-ADLI. While NKPD1 mRNA expression increased during keratinocyte differentiation, stratum corneum ceramides exhibited no significant changes.

387,Class 1 histone deacetylases differentially modulate memory and synaptic genes in a spatial and temporal manner in aged and APP/PS1 mice.,"Epigenetics plays a vital role in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, whether epigenetic alterations during aging can initiate AD and exacerbate AD progression remains unclear. In this study, 3-, 12- and 18- month-old APP/PS1 mice and WT littermates underwent memory tests, then synapse-related gene expression, class 1 histone deacetylases (HDACs) abundance, and H3K9ac levels at target gene promoters, were evaluated in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Our results showed recognition and long-term spatial memory impaired in 18-month-old WT mice and recognition, short-term working, and long-term spatial reference memory deficits in 12-and 18- month-old APP/PS1 mice. The memory impairments are associated with synapse-related gene nr2a, glur1, glur2, psd95 expression, HDAC abundance, and H3K9ac regulation. More specifically, HDAC 2 modulated synapse-related gene expression through H3K9ac at the gene promoters during aging and AD progression in the hippocampus. Conversely, HDAC 3 modulated synapse-related gene expression through H3K9ac at the gene promoters during AD progression in the PFC.

388,Architecture of β-Lactoglobulin Coating Modulates Bioinspired Alginate Dialdehyde-Gelatine/Polydopamine Scaffolds for Subchondral Bone Regeneration.,"In this study, we developed polydopamine (PDA)-functionalized alginate dialdehyde-gelatine (ADA-GEL) scaffolds for subchondral bone regeneration. These polymeric scaffolds were then coated with β-Lactoglobulin (β-LG) at concentrations of 1 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml. Morphological analysis indicated a homogeneous coating of the β-LG layer on the surface of network-like scaffolds. The β-LG-coated scaffolds exhibited improved swelling capacity as a function of the β-LG concentration. Compared to ADA-GEL/PDA scaffolds, the β-LG-coated scaffolds demonstrated delayed degradation and enhanced biomineralization. Here, a lower concentration of β-LG showed long-lasting stability and superior biomimetic hydroxyapatite mineralization. According to the theoretical findings, the single-state, representing the low concentration of β-LG, exhibited homogeneous distribution on the surface of the PDA, while the dimer-state (high concentration) displayed a high likelihood of uncontrolled interactions. β-LG-coated ADA-GEL/PDA scaffolds with a lower concentration of β-LG provided a biocompatible substrate that supported adhesion, proliferation, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) secretion of sheep bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, as well as increased expression of osteopontin (SPP1) and collagen type 1 (COL1A1) in human osteoblasts. These findings indicate the potential of protein-coated scaffolds for subchondral bone tissue regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study addresses a crucial aspect of osteochondral defect repair, emphasizing the pivotal role of subchondral bone regeneration. The development of polydopamine-functionalized alginate dialdehyde-gelatine (ADA-GEL) scaffolds, coated with β-Lactoglobulin (β-LG), represents a novel approach to potentially enhance subchondral bone repair. β-LG, a milk protein rich in essential amino acids and bioactive peptides, is investigated for its potential to promote subchondral bone regeneration. This research explores computationally and experimentally the influence of protein concentration on the ordered or irregular deposition, unravelling the interplay between coating structure, scaffold properties, and in-vitro performance.

389,CXXC5 drove inflammation and ovarian cancer proliferation via transcriptional activation of ZNF143 and EGR1.,"CXXC5, a zinc-finger protein, is known for its role in epigenetic regulation via binding to unmethylated CpG islands in gene promoters. As a transcription factor and epigenetic regulator, CXXC5 modulates various signaling processes and acts as a key coordinator. Altered expression or activity of CXXC5 has been linked to various pathological conditions, including tumorigenesis. Despite its known role in cancer, CXXC5's function and mechanism in ovarian cancer are unclear. We analyzed multiple public databases and found that CXXC5 is highly expressed in ovarian cancer, with high expression correlating with poor patient prognosis. We show that CXXC5 expression is regulated by oxygen concentration and is a direct target of HIF1A. CXXC5 is critical for maintaining the proliferative potential of ovarian cancer cells, with knockdown decreasing and overexpression increasing cell proliferation. Loss of CXXC5 led to inactivation of multiple inflammatory signaling pathways, while overexpression activated these pathways. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we confirmed ZNF143 and EGR1 as downstream transcription factors of CXXC5, mediating its proliferative potential in ovarian cancer. Our findings suggest that the CXXC5-ZNF143/EGR1 axis forms a network driving ovarian cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, and highlight CXXC5 as a potential therapeutic target for ovarian cancer treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642782/,cxxc zincfinger protein known role epigenetic regulation via binding unmethylated cpg island gene promoter transcription factor epigenetic regulator cxxc modulates various signaling process act key coordinator altered expression activity cxxc linked various pathological condition including tumorigenesis despite known role cancer cxxcs function mechanism ovarian cancer unclear analyzed multiple public database found cxxc highly expressed ovarian cancer high expression correlating poor patient prognosis show cxxc expression regulated oxygen concentration direct target hifa cxxc critical maintaining proliferative potential ovarian cancer cell knockdown decreasing overexpression increasing cell proliferation loss cxxc led inactivation multiple inflammatory signaling pathway overexpression activated pathway vitro vivo experiment confirmed znf egr downstream transcription factor cxxc mediating proliferative potential ovarian cancer finding suggest cxxcznfegr axis form network driving ovarian cell proliferation tumorigenesis highlight cxxc potential therapeutic target ovarian cancer treatment

394,Nitrogen fertilization modulates rice phyllosphere functional genes and pathogens through fungal communities.,"The phyllosphere is a vital yet often neglected habitat hosting diverse microorganisms with various functions. However, studies regarding how the composition and functions of the phyllosphere microbiome respond to agricultural practices, like nitrogen fertilization, are limited. This study investigated the effects of long-term nitrogen fertilization with different levels (CK, N90, N210, N330) on the functional genes and pathogens of the rice phyllosphere microbiome. Results showed that the relative abundance of many microbial functional genes in the rice phyllosphere was significantly affected by nitrogen fertilization, especially those involved in C fixation and denitrification genes. Different nitrogen fertilization levels have greater effects on fungal communities than bacteria communities in the rice phyllosphere, and network analysis and structural equation models further elucidate that fungal communities not only changed bacterial-fungal inter-kingdom interactions in the phyllosphere but also contributed to the variation of biogeochemical cycle potential. Besides, the moderate nitrogen fertilization level (N210) was associated with an enrichment of beneficial microbes in the phyllosphere, while also resulting in the lowest abundance of pathogenic fungi (1.14 %). In contrast, the highest abundance of pathogenic fungi (1.64 %) was observed in the highest nitrogen fertilization level (N330). This enrichment of pathogen due to high nitrogen level was also regulated by the fungal communities, as revealed through SEM analysis. Together, we demonstrated that the phyllosphere fungal communities were more sensitive to the nitrogen fertilization levels and played a crucial role in influencing phyllosphere functional profiles including element cycling potential and pathogen abundance. This study expands our knowledge regarding the role of phyllosphere fungal communities in modulating the element cycling and plant health in sustainable agriculture.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642761/,phyllosphere vital yet often neglected habitat hosting diverse microorganism various function however study regarding composition function phyllosphere microbiome respond agricultural practice like nitrogen fertilization limited study investigated effect longterm nitrogen fertilization different level ck n n n functional gene pathogen rice phyllosphere microbiome result showed relative abundance many microbial functional gene rice phyllosphere significantly affected nitrogen fertilization especially involved c fixation denitrification gene different nitrogen fertilization level greater effect fungal community bacteria community rice phyllosphere network analysis structural equation model elucidate fungal community changed bacterialfungal interkingdom interaction phyllosphere also contributed variation biogeochemical cycle potential besides moderate nitrogen fertilization level n associated enrichment beneficial microbe phyllosphere also resulting lowest abundance pathogenic fungi contrast highest abundance pathogenic fungi observed highest nitrogen fertilization level n enrichment pathogen due high nitrogen level also regulated fungal community revealed sem analysis together demonstrated phyllosphere fungal community sensitive nitrogen fertilization level played crucial role influencing phyllosphere functional profile including element cycling potential pathogen abundance study expands knowledge regarding role phyllosphere fungal community modulating element cycling plant health sustainable agriculture
395,Transgenerational acclimation to acidified seawater and gene expression patterns in a sea urchin.,"Transgenerational responses of susceptible calcifying organisms to progressive ocean acidification are an important issue in reducing uncertainty of future predictions. In this study, a two-generation rearing experiment was conducted using mature Mesocentrotus nudus, a major edible sea urchin that occurs along the coasts of northern Japan. Morphological observations and comprehensive gene expression analysis (RNA-seq) of resulting larvae were performed to examine transgenerational acclimation to acidified seawater. Two generations of rearing experiments showed that larvae derived from parents acclimated to acidified seawater tended to have higher survival and show less reduction in body size when exposed to acidified seawater of the same pH, suggesting that a positive carry-over effect occurred. RNA-seq analysis showed that gene expression patterns of larvae originated from both acclimated and non-acclimated parents to acidified seawater tended to be different than control condition, and the gene expression pattern of larvae originated from acclimated parents was substantially different than that of larvae of non-acclimated and control parents.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642751/,transgenerational response susceptible calcifying organism progressive ocean acidification important issue reducing uncertainty future prediction study twogeneration rearing experiment conducted using mature mesocentrotus nudus major edible sea urchin occurs along coast northern japan morphological observation comprehensive gene expression analysis rnaseq resulting larva performed examine transgenerational acclimation acidified seawater two generation rearing experiment showed larva derived parent acclimated acidified seawater tended higher survival show le reduction body size exposed acidified seawater ph suggesting positive carryover effect occurred rnaseq analysis showed gene expression pattern larva originated acclimated nonacclimated parent acidified seawater tended different control condition gene expression pattern larva originated acclimated parent substantially different larva nonacclimated control parent
396,Coping with salinity extremes: Gill transcriptome profiling in the black-chinned tilapia (Sarotherodon melanotheron).,"Steeper and sometimes extreme salinity gradients increasingly affect aquatic organisms because of climate change. Hypersalinity habitats demand powerful physiological adaptive strategies. Few teleost species have the capacity to spend their whole life cycle in salinities way over seawater levels. Focusing on the multifunctional gill, we unraveled the tilapia S. melanotheron key strategies to cope with different environmental conditions, ranging from freshwater up to hypersaline habitats. De novo transcriptome assembly based on RNAseq allowed for the analysis of 40,967 annotated transcripts among samples collected in three wild populations at 0, 40 and 80 ‰. A trend analysis of the expression patterns revealed responses across the salinity gradient with different gene pathways involved. Genes linked to ion transport, pH regulation and cell surface receptor signaling were mainly upregulated in the high salinity habitat. We identified tight junction proteins that were critical in high salinity habitats and that were different from the well-known tightening junctional proteins identified and expressed in fresh water. Expression profiles also suggest a change in the vascular tone that could be linked to an osmorespiratory compromise not only in fresh water, but also in high salinity environments. A striking downregulation of genes linked to the immune system and to the heat shock response was observed suggesting an energetic trade-off between immunity and acclimation/adaptation in the hypersaline habitat. The high expression of transcripts coding for immune and heat shock response in the freshwater habitat suggests the establishment of powerful mechanisms to protect gills from environmental threats and to maintain protein integrity. Non-directional expression trends were also detected with an upregulation of genes only in the hypersaline habitat (80 ‰) or only in the marine habitat (40 ‰). Unravel physiological strategies in S. melanotheron populations will help to better understand the molecular basis of fish euryhalinity in salinity-contrasted environments.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642748/,steeper sometimes extreme salinity gradient increasingly affect aquatic organism climate change hypersalinity habitat demand powerful physiological adaptive strategy teleost specie capacity spend whole life cycle salinity way seawater level focusing multifunctional gill unraveled tilapia melanotheron key strategy cope different environmental condition ranging freshwater hypersaline habitat de novo transcriptome assembly based rnaseq allowed analysis annotated transcript among sample collected three wild population trend analysis expression pattern revealed response across salinity gradient different gene pathway involved gene linked ion transport ph regulation cell surface receptor signaling mainly upregulated high salinity habitat identified tight junction protein critical high salinity habitat different wellknown tightening junctional protein identified expressed fresh water expression profile also suggest change vascular tone could linked osmorespiratory compromise fresh water also high salinity environment striking downregulation gene linked immune system heat shock response observed suggesting energetic tradeoff immunity acclimationadaptation hypersaline habitat high expression transcript coding immune heat shock response freshwater habitat suggests establishment powerful mechanism protect gill environmental threat maintain protein integrity nondirectional expression trend also detected upregulation gene hypersaline habitat marine habitat unravel physiological strategy melanotheron population help better understand molecular basis fish euryhalinity salinitycontrasted environment
397,Differential impact of intermittent versus continuous treatment with clozapine on fatty acid metabolism in the brain of an MK-801-induced mouse model of schizophrenia.,"Continuous antipsychotic treatment is often recommended to prevent relapse in schizophrenia. However, the efficacy of antipsychotic treatment appears to diminish in patients with relapsed schizophrenia and the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Moreover, though the findings are inconclusive, several recent studies suggest that intermittent versus continuous treatment may not significantly differ in recurrence risk and therapeutic efficacy but potentially reduce the drug dose and side effects. Notably, disturbances in fatty acid (FA) metabolism are linked to the onset/relapse of schizophrenia, and patients with multi-episode schizophrenia have been reported to have reduced FA biosynthesis. We thus utilized an MK-801-induced animal model of schizophrenia to evaluate whether two treatment strategies of clozapine would affect drug response and FA metabolism differently in the brain. Schizophrenia-related behaviors were assessed through open field test (OFT) and prepulse inhibition (PPI) test, and FA profiles of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additionally, we measured gene expression levels of enzymes involved in FA synthesis. Both intermittent and continuous clozapine treatment reversed hypermotion and deficits in PPI in mice. Continuous treatment decreased total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and FAs in the PFC, whereas the intermittent administration increased n-6 PUFAs, SFAs and FAs compared to continuous administration. Meanwhile, continuous treatment reduced the expression of Fads1 and Elovl2, while intermittent treatment significantly upregulated them. This study discloses the novel findings that there was no significant difference in clozapine efficacy between continuous and intermittent administration, but intermittent treatment showed certain protective effects on phospholipid metabolism in the PFC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642730/,continuous antipsychotic treatment often recommended prevent relapse schizophrenia however efficacy antipsychotic treatment appears diminish patient relapsed schizophrenia underlying mechanism still unknown moreover though finding inconclusive several recent study suggest intermittent versus continuous treatment may significantly differ recurrence risk therapeutic efficacy potentially reduce drug dose side effect notably disturbance fatty acid fa metabolism linked onsetrelapse schizophrenia patient multiepisode schizophrenia reported reduced fa biosynthesis thus utilized mkinduced animal model schizophrenia evaluate whether two treatment strategy clozapine would affect drug response fa metabolism differently brain schizophreniarelated behavior assessed open field test oft prepulse inhibition ppi test fa profile prefrontal cortex pfc hippocampus analyzed gas chromatographymass spectrometry additionally measured gene expression level enzyme involved fa synthesis intermittent continuous clozapine treatment reversed hypermotion deficit ppi mouse continuous treatment decreased total polyunsaturated fatty acid pufas saturated fatty acid sfas fa pfc whereas intermittent administration increased n pufas sfas fa compared continuous administration meanwhile continuous treatment reduced expression fad elovl intermittent treatment significantly upregulated study discloses novel finding significant difference clozapine efficacy continuous intermittent administration intermittent treatment showed certain protective effect phospholipid metabolism pfc
398,A review of DNA nanoparticles-encapsulated drug/gene/protein for advanced controlled drug release: Current status and future perspective over emerging therapy approaches.,"In the last ten years, the field of nanomedicine has experienced significant progress in creating novel drug delivery systems (DDSs). An effective strategy involves employing DNA nanoparticles (NPs) as carriers to encapsulate drugs, genes, or proteins, facilitating regulated drug release. This abstract examines the utilization of DNA NPs and their potential applications in strategies for controlled drug release. Researchers have utilized the distinctive characteristics of DNA molecules, including their ability to self-assemble and their compatibility with living organisms, to create NPs specifically for the purpose of delivering drugs. The DNA NPs possess numerous benefits compared to conventional drug carriers, such as exceptional stability, adjustable dimensions and structure, and convenient customization. Researchers have successfully achieved a highly efficient encapsulation of different therapeutic agents by carefully designing their structure and composition. This advancement enables precise and targeted delivery of drugs. The incorporation of drugs, genes, or proteins into DNA NPs provides notable advantages in terms of augmenting therapeutic effectiveness while reducing adverse effects. DNA NPs serve as a protective barrier for the enclosed payloads, preventing their degradation and extending their duration in the body. The protective effect is especially vital for delicate biologics, such as proteins or gene-based therapies that could otherwise be vulnerable to enzymatic degradation or quick elimination. Moreover, the surface of DNA NPs can be altered to facilitate specific targeting towards particular tissues or cells, thereby augmenting the accuracy of delivery. A significant benefit of DNA NPs is their capacity to regulate the kinetics of drug release. Through the manipulation of the DNA NPs structure, scientists can regulate the rate at which the enclosed cargo is released, enabling a prolonged and regulated dispensation of medication. This control is crucial for medications with limited therapeutic ranges or those necessitating uninterrupted administration to attain optimal therapeutic results. In addition, DNA NPs have the ability to react to external factors, including alterations in temperature, pH, or light, which can initiate the release of the payload at precise locations or moments. This feature enhances the precision of drug release control. The potential uses of DNA NPs in the controlled release of medicines are extensive.

399,Goat milk exosomal microRNAs alleviate LPS-induced intestinal inflammation in mice.,"Intestinal inflammation is a common digestive system disease. Milk-derived exosomes can participate in intercellular communication and transport a variety of bioactive components, and the microRNAs (miRNAs) they carry play important roles in a variety of biological processes in the body. At present, the preventive effect and mechanism of action of goat milk exosomes and their derived miRNAs on intestinal inflammation are still unclear. In this study, the protective effect of goat milk exosomes on LPS-induced intestinal inflammation was investigated using mouse intestinal inflammation model and IEC-6 cell inflammation model. Small RNA sequencing was used to analyze the miRNA expression profile of goat milk exosomes. In this study, C-Exo and M-Exo alleviated intestinal inflammation by reducing the LPS-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines, inhibiting the increase in the NLRP3 protein and the activation of the TLR4/NFκB signaling pathway. C-Exo has a more significant inhibitory effect on them, and better therapeutic efficacy than M-Exo. Notably, the target genes of miRNAs in C-Exo and M-Exo were significantly enriched in immune-related pathways. Furthermore, their derived miR-26a-5p and miR-30a-5p were found to ameliorate the IEC-6 inflammatory response. These findings suggest that miRNAs in goat milk exosomes have the potential to attenuate LPS-induced intestinal inflammation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642690/,intestinal inflammation common digestive system disease milkderived exosomes participate intercellular communication transport variety bioactive component micrornas mirnas carry play important role variety biological process body present preventive effect mechanism action goat milk exosomes derived mirnas intestinal inflammation still unclear study protective effect goat milk exosomes lpsinduced intestinal inflammation investigated using mouse intestinal inflammation model iec cell inflammation model small rna sequencing used analyze mirna expression profile goat milk exosomes study cexo mexo alleviated intestinal inflammation reducing lpsinduced release proinflammatory cytokine inhibiting increase nlrp protein activation tlrnfb signaling pathway cexo significant inhibitory effect better therapeutic efficacy mexo notably target gene mirnas cexo mexo significantly enriched immunerelated pathway furthermore derived mirap mirap found ameliorate iec inflammatory response finding suggest mirnas goat milk exosomes potential attenuate lpsinduced intestinal inflammation
400,Chemo-photothermal therapy of chitosan/gold nanorod clusters for antibacterial treatment against the infection of planktonic and biofilm MRSA.,"Bacterial infections trigger inflammation and impede the closure of skin wounds. The misuse of antibiotics exacerbates skin infections by generating multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this study, we developed chemo-photothermal therapy (chemo-PTT) based on near-infrared (NIR)-irradiated chitosan/gold nanorod (GNR) clusters as anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) agents. The nanocomposites exhibited an average size of 223 nm with a surface charge of 36 mV. These plasmonic nanocomposites demonstrated on-demand and rapid hyperthermal action under NIR. The combined effect of positive charge and PTT by NIR-irradiated nanocomposites resulted in a remarkable inhibition rate of 96 % against planktonic MRSA, indicating a synergistic activity compared to chitosan nanoparticles or GNR alone. The nanocomposites easily penetrated the biofilm matrix. The combination of chemical and photothermal treatments by NIR-stimulated clusters significantly damaged the biofilm structure, eradicating MRSA inside the biomass. NIR-irradiated chitosan/GNR clusters increased the skin temperature of mice by 13 °C. The plasmonic nanocomposites induced negligible skin irritation in vivo. In summary, this novel nanosystem demonstrated potent antibacterial effects against planktonic and biofilm MRSA, showcasing the possible efficacy in treating skin infections.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642681/,bacterial infection trigger inflammation impede closure skin wound misuse antibiotic exacerbates skin infection generating multidrugresistant bacteria study developed chemophotothermal therapy chemoptt based nearinfrared nirirradiated chitosangold nanorod gnr cluster antimethicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa agent nanocomposites exhibited average size nm surface charge mv plasmonic nanocomposites demonstrated ondemand rapid hyperthermal action nir combined effect positive charge ptt nirirradiated nanocomposites resulted remarkable inhibition rate planktonic mrsa indicating synergistic activity compared chitosan nanoparticles gnr alone nanocomposites easily penetrated biofilm matrix combination chemical photothermal treatment nirstimulated cluster significantly damaged biofilm structure eradicating mrsa inside biomass nirirradiated chitosangnr cluster increased skin temperature mouse c plasmonic nanocomposites induced negligible skin irritation vivo summary novel nanosystem demonstrated potent antibacterial effect planktonic biofilm mrsa showcasing possible efficacy treating skin infection
401,"Exosomes derived from vMIP-II-Lamp2b gene-modified M2 cells provide neuroprotection by targeting the injured spinal cord, inhibiting chemokine signals and modulating microglia/macrophage polarization in mice.","Inflammation is one of the key injury factors for spinal cord injury (SCI). Exosomes (Exos) derived from M2 macrophages have been shown to inhibit inflammation and be beneficial in SCI animal models. However, lacking targetability restricts their application prospects. Considering that chemokine receptors increase dramatically after SCI, viral macrophage inflammatory protein II (vMIP-II) is a broad-spectrum chemokine receptor binding peptide, and lysosomal associated membrane protein 2b (Lamp2b) is the key membrane component of Exos, we speculated that vMIP-II-Lamp2b gene-modified M2 macrophage-derived Exos (vMIP-II-Lamp2b-M2-Exo) not only have anti-inflammatory properties, but also can target the injured area by vMIP-II. In this study, using a murine contusive SCI model, we revealed that vMIP-II-Lamp2b-M2-Exo could target the chemokine receptors which highly expressed in the injured spinal cords, inhibit some key chemokine receptor signaling pathways (such as MAPK and Akt), further inhibit proinflammatory factors (such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, IL-18, TNF-α, and iNOS), and promote anti-inflammatory factors (such as IL-4 and Arg1) productions, and the transformation of microglia/macrophages from M1 into M2. Moreover, the improved histological and functional recoveries were also found. Collectively, our results suggest that vMIP-II-Lamp2b-M2-Exo may provide neuroprotection by targeting the injured spinal cord, inhibiting some chemokine signals, reducing proinflammatory factor production and modulating microglia/macrophage polarization.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642665/,inflammation one key injury factor spinal cord injury sci exosomes exos derived macrophage shown inhibit inflammation beneficial sci animal model however lacking targetability restricts application prospect considering chemokine receptor increase dramatically sci viral macrophage inflammatory protein ii vmipii broadspectrum chemokine receptor binding peptide lysosomal associated membrane protein b lampb key membrane component exos speculated vmipiilampb genemodified macrophagederived exos vmipiilampbmexo antiinflammatory property also target injured area vmipii study using murine contusive sci model revealed vmipiilampbmexo could target chemokine receptor highly expressed injured spinal cord inhibit key chemokine receptor signaling pathway mapk akt inhibit proinflammatory factor il il il il tnf inos promote antiinflammatory factor il arg production transformation microgliamacrophages moreover improved histological functional recovery also found collectively result suggest vmipiilampbmexo may provide neuroprotection targeting injured spinal cord inhibiting chemokine signal reducing proinflammatory factor production modulating microgliamacrophage polarization

403,Single-cell analysis identifies critical regulators of spermatogonial development and differentiation in cattle-yak bulls.,"Spermatogenesis is a continuous process in which functional sperm are produced through a series of mitotic and meiotic divisions and morphological changes in germ cells. The aberrant development and fate transitions of spermatogenic cells cause hybrid sterility in mammals. Cattle-yak, a hybrid animal between taurine cattle (Bos taurus) and yak (Bos grunniens), exhibits male-specific sterility due to spermatogenic failure. In the present study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to identify differences in testicular cell composition and the developmental trajectory of spermatogenic cells between yak and cattle-yak. The composition and molecular signatures of spermatogonial subtypes were dramatically different between these 2 animals, and the expression of genes associated with stem cell maintenance, cell differentiation and meiotic entry was altered in cattle-yak, indicating the impairment of undifferentiated spermatogonial fate decisions. Cell communication analysis revealed that signaling within different spermatogenic cell subpopulations was weakened, and progenitor spermatogonia were unable or delayed receiving and sending signals for transformation to the next stage in cattle-yak. Simultaneously, the communication between niche cells and germ cells was also abnormal. Collectively, we obtained the expression profiles of transcriptome signatures of different germ cells and testicular somatic cell populations at the single-cell level and identified critical regulators of spermatogonial differentiation and meiosis in yak and sterile cattle-yak. The findings of this study shed light on the genetic mechanisms that lead to hybrid sterility and speciation in bovid species.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642661/,spermatogenesis continuous process functional sperm produced series mitotic meiotic division morphological change germ cell aberrant development fate transition spermatogenic cell cause hybrid sterility mammal cattleyak hybrid animal taurine cattle bos taurus yak bos grunniens exhibit malespecific sterility due spermatogenic failure present study performed singlecell rna sequencing analysis identify difference testicular cell composition developmental trajectory spermatogenic cell yak cattleyak composition molecular signature spermatogonial subtypes dramatically different animal expression gene associated stem cell maintenance cell differentiation meiotic entry altered cattleyak indicating impairment undifferentiated spermatogonial fate decision cell communication analysis revealed signaling within different spermatogenic cell subpopulation weakened progenitor spermatogonia unable delayed receiving sending signal transformation next stage cattleyak simultaneously communication niche cell germ cell also abnormal collectively obtained expression profile transcriptome signature different germ cell testicular somatic cell population singlecell level identified critical regulator spermatogonial differentiation meiosis yak sterile cattleyak finding study shed light genetic mechanism lead hybrid sterility speciation bovid specie
404,Endometrial responsiveness to interferon-tau and its association with subsequent reproductive performance in dairy heifers.,"Our objectives were to evaluate the endometrial responsiveness of dairy heifers to an intrauterine infusion of recombinant bovine interferon-tau (rbIFN-τ) and to associate endometrial responses to rbIFN-τ with subsequent reproductive performance. In Experiments 1 and 2, cyclic heifers were enrolled in a 5-d CIDR Cosynch program for estrous synchronization, and blood sampling and ultrasonography examinations were performed on d 0, 4, 7, 11, and 14 of the estrous cycle. In Experiment 1, heifers were randomly assigned to receive an intrauterine infusion containing 2 µg of rbIFN-τ (rbIFN-τ = 19) or saline (CTRL = 19) into the uterine horn ipsilateral to the corpus luteum (CL) on d 14 of the estrous cycle. Six hours after the infusion, the infused uterine horn was flushed for sampling of the uterine luminal fluid (ULF) for analyses of composition, and the endometrium was biopsied for transcriptomics. In Experiment 2, 100 heifers received an intrauterine infusion of rbIFN-τ, and the same procedures for uterine sample collection described in Experiment 1 were performed. After the intrauterine test, heifers were enrolled in a breeding program and classified as highly fertile (HF; pregnant at first AI) or subfertile (SF; not pregnant at first AI). Statistical analyses were performed using linear regression models, which included the effects of treatment (Experiment 1: CTRL vs. rbIFN-τ) or fertility group (Experiment 2: HF vs. SF) and block of samples. Intrauterine infusion of rbIFN-τ increased the expression of classical interferon-stimulated genes in the endometrium (e.g., ISG15, MX1, OAS2, IRF9, and USP18), and an antiviral response was predicted to be the main downstream effect of the transcriptome changes. In addition, rbIFN-τ increased the abundance of cholesterol, glycerol, and the overall concentration of oxylipins in the ULF. Analysis of endometrial transcriptome between HF and SF heifers revealed important differences in the expression of proteins associated with cell signaling, metabolism, attachment, and migration, with a large representation of genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins. In general, differently expressed genes were expected to be downregulated by IFN-τ but seemed to fail to be downregulated in SF heifers, resulting in higher expression in SF compared with HF heifers. Subfertile heifers had lower concentrations of glycerol and an altered profile of oxylipins in the ULF, with lower abundance of oxylipins derived from arachidonic acid and dihomo-γ-linolenic acid, and greater abundance of oxylipins derived from linoleic acid. Measurements of ovarian function did not differ between groups and, therefore, did not influence the observed results in uterine biology. In conclusion, the endometrial responsiveness to IFN-τ is variable among individuals and associated with subsequent fertility of heifers, indicating that communication between conceptus and endometrium is critical for the uterine receptivity and survival of pregnancy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642656/,objective evaluate endometrial responsiveness dairy heifer intrauterine infusion recombinant bovine interferontau rbifn associate endometrial response rbifn subsequent reproductive performance experiment cyclic heifer enrolled cidr cosynch program estrous synchronization blood sampling ultrasonography examination performed estrous cycle experiment heifer randomly assigned receive intrauterine infusion containing g rbifn rbifn saline ctrl uterine horn ipsilateral corpus luteum cl estrous cycle six hour infusion infused uterine horn flushed sampling uterine luminal fluid ulf analysis composition endometrium biopsied transcriptomics experiment heifer received intrauterine infusion rbifn procedure uterine sample collection described experiment performed intrauterine test heifer enrolled breeding program classified highly fertile hf pregnant first ai subfertile sf pregnant first ai statistical analysis performed using linear regression model included effect treatment experiment ctrl v rbifn fertility group experiment hf v sf block sample intrauterine infusion rbifn increased expression classical interferonstimulated gene endometrium eg isg mx oas irf usp antiviral response predicted main downstream effect transcriptome change addition rbifn increased abundance cholesterol glycerol overall concentration oxylipins ulf analysis endometrial transcriptome hf sf heifer revealed important difference expression protein associated cell signaling metabolism attachment migration large representation gene encoding extracellular matrix protein general differently expressed gene expected downregulated ifn seemed fail downregulated sf heifer resulting higher expression sf compared hf heifer subfertile heifer lower concentration glycerol altered profile oxylipins ulf lower abundance oxylipins derived arachidonic acid dihomolinolenic acid greater abundance oxylipins derived linoleic acid measurement ovarian function differ group therefore influence observed result uterine biology conclusion endometrial responsiveness ifn variable among individual associated subsequent fertility heifer indicating communication conceptus endometrium critical uterine receptivity survival pregnancy
405,HH5 Double-Carrier Embryos Fail to Progress through Early Conceptus Elongation.,"Massive genotyping in cattle has uncovered several deleterious haplotypes that cause pre-term mortality. Holstein Haplotype 5 (HH5) is a deleterious haplotype present in the Holstein Friesian population that involves the ablation of the Transcription Factor B1 mitochondrial (TFB1M) gene. The developmental stage at which HH5 double-carrier (DC, homozygous) embryos or fetuses die remains unknown and this is a relevant information to estimate the economic losses associated to the inadvertent cross between carriers. To determine if HH5 DC survive to maternal recognition of pregnancy, embryonic day (E)14 embryos were flushed from superovulated carrier cows inseminated with a carrier bull. DC E14 conceptuses were recovered at Mendelian rates but they failed to achieve early elongation, as evidenced by a drastic (>26-fold) reduction in the proliferation of extraembryonic membranes compared with carrier or non-carrier embryos. To assess development at earlier stages, TFB1M knockout (KO) embryos -functionally equivalent to DC embryos- were generated by CRISPR technology and cultured to the blastocyst stage -Day (D)8- and to the early embryonic disc stage -D12-. No significant effect of TFB1M ablation was observed on the differentiation and proliferation of embryonic lineages and relative mtDNA content up to D12. In conclusion, HH5 DC embryos are able to develop to early embryonic disc stage but fail to undergo early conceptus elongation, required for pregnancy recognition.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642647/,massive genotyping cattle uncovered several deleterious haplotype cause preterm mortality holstein haplotype hh deleterious haplotype present holstein friesian population involves ablation transcription factor b mitochondrial tfbm gene developmental stage hh doublecarrier dc homozygous embryo fetus die remains unknown relevant information estimate economic loss associated inadvertent cross carrier determine hh dc survive maternal recognition pregnancy embryonic day e embryo flushed superovulated carrier cow inseminated carrier bull dc e conceptus recovered mendelian rate failed achieve early elongation evidenced drastic fold reduction proliferation extraembryonic membrane compared carrier noncarrier embryo ass development earlier stage tfbm knockout ko embryo functionally equivalent dc embryo generated crispr technology cultured blastocyst stage day early embryonic disc stage significant effect tfbm ablation observed differentiation proliferation embryonic lineage relative mtdna content conclusion hh dc embryo able develop early embryonic disc stage fail undergo early conceptus elongation required pregnancy recognition
406,Harnessing artificial intelligence-driven approach for enhanced indole-3-acetic acid from the newly isolated Streptomyces rutgersensis AW08.,"Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) derived from Actinobacteria fermentations on agro-wastes constitutes a safer and low-cost alternative to synthetic IAA. This study aims to select a high IAA-producing Streptomyces-like strain isolated from Lake Oubeira sediments (El Kala, Algeria) for further investigations (i.e., 16S rRNA gene barcoding and process optimization). Subsequently, artificial intelligence-based approaches were employed to maximize IAA bioproduction on spent coffee grounds as high-value-added feedstock. The specificity was the novel application of the Limited-Memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno Box (L-BFGS-B) optimization algorithm. The new strain AW08 was a significant producer of IAA (26.116 ± 0.61 μg/mL) and was identified as Streptomyces rutgersensis by 16S rRNA gene barcoding and phylogenetic inquiry. The empirical data involved the inoculation of AW08 in various cultural conditions according to a four-factor Box Behnken Design matrix (BBD) of Response surface methodology (RSM). The input parameters and regression equation extracted from the RSM-BBD were the basis for implementing and training the L-BFGS-B algorithm. Upon training the model, the optimal conditions suggested by the BBD and L-BFGS-B algorithm were, respectively, L-Trp (X1) = 0.58 %; 0.57 %; T° (X2) = 26.37 °C; 28.19 °C; pH (X3) = 7.75; 8.59; and carbon source (X4) = 30 %; 33.29 %, with the predicted response IAA (Y) =152.8; 169.18 μg/mL). Our findings emphasize the potential of the multifunctional S. rutgersensis AW08, isolated and reported for the first time in Algeria, as a robust producer of IAA. Validation investigations using the bioprocess parameters provided by the L-BFGS-B and the BBD-RSM models demonstrate the effectiveness of AI-driven optimization in maximizing IAA output by 5.43-fold and 4.2-fold, respectively. This study constitutes the first paper reporting a novel interdisciplinary approach and providing insights into biotechnological advancements.

407,The nucleolus: Coordinating stress response and genomic stability.,"The perception that the nucleoli are merely the organelles where ribosome biogenesis occurs is challenged. Only around 30 % of nucleolar proteins are solely involved in producing ribosomes. Instead, the nucleolus plays a critical role in controlling protein trafficking during stress and, according to its dynamic nature, undergoes continuous protein exchange with nucleoplasm under various cellular stressors. Hence, the concept of nucleolar stress has evolved as cellular insults that disrupt the structure and function of the nucleolus. Considering the emerging role of this organelle in DNA repair and the fact that rDNAs are the most fragile genomic loci, therapies targeting the nucleoli are increasingly being developed. Besides, drugs that target ribosome synthesis and induce nucleolar stress can be used in cancer therapy. In contrast, agents that regulate nucleolar activity may be a potential treatment for neurodegeneration caused by abnormal protein accumulation in the nucleolus. Here, I explore the roles of nucleoli beyond their ribosomal functions, highlighting the factors triggering nucleolar stress and their impact on genomic stability.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642633/,perception nucleolus merely organelle ribosome biogenesis occurs challenged around nucleolar protein solely involved producing ribosome instead nucleolus play critical role controlling protein trafficking stress according dynamic nature undergoes continuous protein exchange nucleoplasm various cellular stressor hence concept nucleolar stress evolved cellular insult disrupt structure function nucleolus considering emerging role organelle dna repair fact rdnas fragile genomic locus therapy targeting nucleolus increasingly developed besides drug target ribosome synthesis induce nucleolar stress used cancer therapy contrast agent regulate nucleolar activity may potential treatment neurodegeneration caused abnormal protein accumulation nucleolus explore role nucleolus beyond ribosomal function highlighting factor triggering nucleolar stress impact genomic stability

410,Polymorphisms in the cysteine dioxygenase gene and their association with taurine content in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas.,"The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is rich in taurine, which is crucial for its adaptation to the fluctuating intertidal environment and presents significant potential in improving taurine nutrition and boosting immunity in humans. Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) is a key enzyme involved in the initial step of taurine biosynthesis and plays a crucial role in regulating taurine content in the body. In the present study, polymorphisms of CDO gene in C. gigas (CgCDO) and their association with taurine content were evaluated in 198 individuals. A total of 24 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci were identified in the exonic region of the CgCDO gene by direct sequencing. Among these SNPs, c.279G > A and c.287C > A were found to be significantly associated with taurine content, with the GG and AA genotype at the two loci exhibiting enhanced taurine accumulation (p < 0.05). Haplotype analysis revealed that the 279GG/287AA haplotype had the highest taurine content of 29.24 mg/g, while the 279AA/287CC haplotype showed the lowest taurine content of 21.19 mg/g.

412,Persistent ∆FosB expression limits recurrent seizure activity and provides neuroprotection in the dentate gyrus of APP mice.,"Recurrent seizures lead to accumulation of the activity-dependent transcription factor ∆FosB in hippocampal dentate granule cells in both mouse models of epilepsy and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is also associated with increased incidence of seizures. In patients with AD and related mouse models, the degree of ∆FosB accumulation corresponds with increasing severity of cognitive deficits. We previously found that ∆FosB impairs spatial memory in mice by epigenetically regulating expression of target genes such as calbindin that are involved in synaptic plasticity. However, the suppression of calbindin in conditions of neuronal hyperexcitability has been demonstrated to provide neuroprotection to dentate granule cells, indicating that ∆FosB may act over long timescales to coordinate neuroprotective pathways. To test this hypothesis, we used viral-mediated expression of ∆JunD to interfere with ∆FosB signaling over the course of several months in transgenic mice expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP), which exhibit spontaneous seizures and develop AD-related neuropathology and cognitive deficits. Our results demonstrate that persistent ∆FosB activity acts through discrete modes of hippocampal target gene regulation to modulate neuronal excitability, limit recurrent seizure activity, and provide neuroprotection to hippocampal dentate granule cells in APP mice.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642602/,recurrent seizure lead accumulation activitydependent transcription factor fosb hippocampal dentate granule cell mouse model epilepsy mouse model alzheimers disease ad also associated increased incidence seizure patient ad related mouse model degree fosb accumulation corresponds increasing severity cognitive deficit previously found fosb impairs spatial memory mouse epigenetically regulating expression target gene calbindin involved synaptic plasticity however suppression calbindin condition neuronal hyperexcitability demonstrated provide neuroprotection dentate granule cell indicating fosb may act long timescales coordinate neuroprotective pathway test hypothesis used viralmediated expression jund interfere fosb signaling course several month transgenic mouse expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein app exhibit spontaneous seizure develop adrelated neuropathology cognitive deficit result demonstrate persistent fosb activity act discrete mode hippocampal target gene regulation modulate neuronal excitability limit recurrent seizure activity provide neuroprotection hippocampal dentate granule cell app mouse
413,Targeting MicroRNA in Myopia: Current Insights.,"Myopia, the most prevalent eye condition, has sparked notable interest regarding its origin and prevention. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNA strands typically consisting of 18-24 nucleotides. They play a central role in post-transcriptional gene regulation and are closely associated with both normal and pathological processes in organisms. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics have provided novel insights into miRNA expression and its regulatory role in myopia. This review discusses the distinct expression patterns, regulatory functions, and potential pathways of miRNAs involved in the onset and progression of myopia.

414,Corneal fibrosis: From in vitro models to current and upcoming drug and gene medicines.,"Fibrotic diseases are characterised by myofibroblast differentiation, uncontrolled pathological extracellular matrix accumulation, tissue contraction, scar formation and, ultimately tissue / organ dysfunction. The cornea, the transparent tissue located on the anterior chamber of the eye, is extremely susceptible to fibrotic diseases, which cause loss of corneal transparency and are often associated with blindness. Although topical corticosteroids and antimetabolites are extensively used in the management of corneal fibrosis, they are associated with glaucoma, cataract formation, corneoscleral melting and infection, imposing the need of far more effective therapies. Herein, we summarise and discuss shortfalls and recent advances in in vitro models (e.g. transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) / ascorbic acid / interleukin (IL) induced) and drug (e.g. TGF-β inhibitors, epigenetic modulators) and gene (e.g. gene editing, gene silencing) therapeutic strategies in the corneal fibrosis context.

415,"Challenging diagnosis of resistance to thyroid hormone in a patient with COVID-19, pituitary microadenoma and unusual response to octreotide long-acting release test.","The resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome (RTHβ) occurs uncommonly and requires a high level of clinical suspicion and specific investigations to reach a precise diagnosis and to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful therapies. We report a case of a young male patient referred to our unit for SARS-CoV-2 infection and atrial fibrillation with elevated thyroid hormones and non-suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), for which antithyroid therapy was prescribed. A mood disorder was reported in the medical history. The family history was unknown as the patient was adopted. Thyroid-specific antibodies were undetectable, and thyroid ultrasound revealed a normal thyroid gland without nodules. After the resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the diagnostic workup continued, and the pituitary MRI revealed a small area ascribable to a microadenoma. Due to atrial fibrillation, the execution of the T3 test was contraindicated. The octreotide long-acting release (LAR) test showed an initial reduction of free thyroid hormones levels at first administration, which was consistent with the presence of a TSH-secreting pituitary tumour, although an escape from the response was observed after the following two injections of octreotide LAR. Indeed, the genetic investigation revealed a variant in heterozygosity of the THRβ gene (Pro453Ser), thus leading to an RTHβ diagnosis, and, therefore, medical treatment with triiodothyroacetic acid was initiated.

416,Generation of human alveolar epithelial type I cells from pluripotent stem cells.,"Alveolar epithelial type I cells (AT1s) line the gas exchange barrier of the distal lung and have been historically challenging to isolate or maintain in cell culture. Here, we engineer a human in vitro AT1 model system via directed differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We use primary adult AT1 global transcriptomes to suggest benchmarks and pathways, such as Hippo-LATS-YAP/TAZ signaling, enriched in these cells. Next, we generate iPSC-derived alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2s) and find that nuclear YAP signaling is sufficient to promote a broad transcriptomic shift from AT2 to AT1 gene programs. The resulting cells express a molecular, morphologic, and functional phenotype reminiscent of human AT1 cells, including the capacity to form a flat epithelial barrier producing characteristic extracellular matrix molecules and secreted ligands. Our results provide an in vitro model of human alveolar epithelial differentiation and a potential source of human AT1s.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642558/,alveolar epithelial type cell at line gas exchange barrier distal lung historically challenging isolate maintain cell culture engineer human vitro model system via directed differentiation induced pluripotent stem cell ipscs use primary adult global transcriptomes suggest benchmark pathway hippolatsyaptaz signaling enriched cell next generate ipscderived alveolar epithelial type ii cell at find nuclear yap signaling sufficient promote broad transcriptomic shift gene program resulting cell express molecular morphologic functional phenotype reminiscent human cell including capacity form flat epithelial barrier producing characteristic extracellular matrix molecule secreted ligand result provide vitro model human alveolar epithelial differentiation potential source human at
417,Genome-first evaluation with exome sequence and clinical data uncovers underdiagnosed genetic disorders in a large healthcare system.,"Population-based genomic screening may help diagnose individuals with disease-risk variants. Here, we perform a genome-first evaluation for nine disorders in 29,039 participants with linked exome sequences and electronic health records (EHRs). We identify 614 individuals with 303 pathogenic/likely pathogenic or predicted loss-of-function (P/LP/LoF) variants, yielding 644 observations; 487 observations (76%) lack a corresponding clinical diagnosis in the EHR. Upon further investigation, 75 clinically undiagnosed observations (15%) have evidence of symptomatic untreated disease, including familial hypercholesterolemia (3 of 6 [50%] undiagnosed observations with disease evidence) and breast cancer (23 of 106 [22%]). These genetic findings enable targeted phenotyping that reveals new diagnoses in previously undiagnosed individuals. Disease yield is greater with variants in penetrant genes for which disease is observed in carriers in an independent cohort. The prevalence of P/LP/LoF variants exceeds that of clinical diagnoses, and some clinically undiagnosed carriers are discovered to have disease.

418,Myosin inhibitor reverses hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in genotypically diverse pediatric iPSC-cardiomyocytes to mirror variant correction.,"Pathogenic variants in MYH7 and MYBPC3 account for the majority of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Targeted drugs like myosin ATPase inhibitors have not been evaluated in children. We generate patient and variant-corrected iPSC-cardiomyocytes (CMs) from pediatric HCM patients harboring single variants in MYH7 (V606M; R453C), MYBPC3 (G148R) or digenic variants (MYBPC3 P955fs, TNNI3 A157V). We also generate CMs harboring MYBPC3 mono- and biallelic variants using CRISPR editing of a healthy control. Compared with isogenic and healthy controls, variant-positive CMs show sarcomere disorganization, higher contractility, calcium transients, and ATPase activity. However, only MYH7 and biallelic MYBPC3 variant-positive CMs show stronger myosin-actin binding. Targeted myosin ATPase inhibitors show complete rescue of the phenotype in variant-positive CMs and in cardiac Biowires to mirror isogenic controls.

Mice were divided into four groups and received normal diet (ND), high-fat diet (HFD) and HFD+QTB (180, 360 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. The results showed that QTB significantly reduced the body weight of HFD mice, ameliorated liver lipid and dyslipidemia, and increased the level of intestinal SCFAs in HFD mice. The results of 16 S rRNA showed that the relative abundance of Bacteroides, Blautia and Lachnoclostridium and their main metabolites acetate and propionate were significantly increased after QTB intervention. The relative abundance of Colidextribacter, Faecalibaculum and Lactobacillus was significantly reduced. QTB can also significantly up-regulate the expression of ATGL, PPARα, FFAR2 and FFAR3, and inhibit the expression of LXRα, SREBP-1c, FAS and HMGCR genes.

422,Meningioma achieves malignancy and erastin-induced ferroptosis resistance through FOXM1-AURKA-NRF2 axis.,"The oncogene Aurora kinase A (AURKA) has been implicated in various tumor, yet its role in meningioma remains unexplored. Recent studies have suggested a potential link between AURKA and ferroptosis, although the underlying mechanisms are unclear. This study presented evidence of AURKA upregulation in high grade meningioma and its ability to enhance malignant characteristics. We identified AURKA as a suppressor of erastin-induced ferroptosis in meningioma. Mechanistically, AURKA directly interacted with and phosphorylated kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), thereby activating nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (NFE2L2/NRF2) and target genes transcription. Additionally, forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) facilitated the transcription of AURKA. Suppression of AURKA, in conjunction with erastin, yields significant enhancements in the prognosis of a murine model of meningioma. Our study elucidates an unidentified mechanism by which AURKA governs ferroptosis, and strongly suggests that the combination of AURKA inhibition and ferroptosis-inducing agents could potentially provide therapeutic benefits for meningioma treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642502/,oncogene aurora kinase aurka implicated various tumor yet role meningioma remains unexplored recent study suggested potential link aurka ferroptosis although underlying mechanism unclear study presented evidence aurka upregulation high grade meningioma ability enhance malignant characteristic identified aurka suppressor erastininduced ferroptosis meningioma mechanistically aurka directly interacted phosphorylated kelchlike echassociated protein keap thereby activating nuclear factor erythroid related factor nfelnrf target gene transcription additionally forkhead box protein foxm facilitated transcription aurka suppression aurka conjunction erastin yield significant enhancement prognosis murine model meningioma study elucidates unidentified mechanism aurka governs ferroptosis strongly suggests combination aurka inhibition ferroptosisinducing agent could potentially provide therapeutic benefit meningioma treatment
423,Vitamin D triggers hCAP18/LL-37 production: Implications for LL-37-induced human osteoblast cytotoxicity.,"The human cathelicidin LL-37 shows activity against microorganisms, but it is also cytotoxic to host cells. The CAMP gene codes for the LL-37 precursor hCAP18 which is processed extracellularly to active LL-37. It has previously been shown that vitamin D stimulates CAMP gene activity, but less information is available demonstrating that vitamin D also can increase hCAP18/LL-37 protein production. Here, we show with RT-qPCR that a physiological concentration of vitamin D (50 nM) enhances CAMP mRNA levels by about 170 times in human THP-1 monocyte cells. Stimulation with 50 nM vitamin D increases hCAP18/LL-37 protein contents 3-4 times in THP-1 cell lysates demonstrated by both dot blot analysis and ELISA applying two different hCAP18/LL-37 antibodies. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 enhances hCAP18/LL-37 levels, suggesting that turnover of hCAP18/LL-37 protein is regulated by the proteasome. The hCAP18/LL-37 concentration in vitamin D-stimulated THP-1 cells corresponds to 1.04 μM LL-37. Interestingly, synthetic LL-37, at this concentration, reduces viability of human osteoblast-like MG63 cells, whereas the THP-1 cells are less sensitive as demonstrated by the MTT assay. In summary, we show that vitamin D enhances hCAP18/LL-37 production, and that this effect can be of physiological/pathophysiological relevance for LL-37-induced human osteoblast toxicity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642493/,human cathelicidin show activity microorganism also cytotoxic host cell camp gene code precursor hcap processed extracellularly active previously shown vitamin stimulates camp gene activity le information available demonstrating vitamin also increase hcapll protein production show rtqpcr physiological concentration vitamin nm enhances camp mrna level time human thp monocyte cell stimulation nm vitamin increase hcapll protein content time thp cell lysates demonstrated dot blot analysis elisa applying two different hcapll antibody treatment proteasome inhibitor mg enhances hcapll level suggesting turnover hcapll protein regulated proteasome hcapll concentration vitamin dstimulated thp cell corresponds interestingly synthetic concentration reduces viability human osteoblastlike mg cell whereas thp cell le sensitive demonstrated mtt assay summary show vitamin enhances hcapll production effect physiologicalpathophysiological relevance llinduced human osteoblast toxicity
424,Development of a gene-coded biosensor to establish a high-throughput screening platform for salidroside production.,"Metabolic engineering reconfigures cellular networks to produce value-added compounds from renewable substrates efficiently. However, identifying strains with desired phenotypes from large libraries through rational or random mutagenesis remains challenging. To overcome this bottleneck, an effective high-throughput screening (HTS) method must be developed to detect and analyze target candidates rapidly. Salidroside is an aromatic compound with broad applications in food, healthcare, medicine, and daily chemicals. However, there currently needs to be HTS methods available to monitor salidroside levels or to screen enzyme variants and strains for high-yield salidroside biosynthesis, which severely limits the development of microbial cell factories capable of efficiently producing salidroside on an industrial scale. This study developed a gene-encoded whole-cell biosensor that is specifically responsive to salidroside. The biosensor was created by screening a site-saturated mutagenic library of uric acid response regulatory protein binding bags. This work demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring metabolic flux with whole-cell biosensors for critical metabolites.

426,Molecular characterization of Escherichia coli isolates recovered from broilers with cellulitis.,"Avian cellulitis in broilers, caused by avian pathogenic Escherichia coli, is a major cause for carcass rejections during meat inspection, resulting in significant economic losses. In this study, we analysed E. coli isolates obtained from broiler chickens affected by cellulitis for their genetic relatedness and antimicrobial resistance phenotype and genotype. The objective was to determine whether there is a clonal spread or whether these clinical isolates differ. For this purpose, E. coli was isolated from swab samples collected from diseased broilers across 77 poultry farms in Germany, resulting in 107 isolates. These isolates were subjected to serotyping, PCR-based phylotyping and macrorestriction analysis with subsequent pulsed-field gel-electrophoresis for typing purposes. In addition, the presence of virulence genes associated with avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) was investigated by PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was examined by the disk diffusion method according to CLSI guidelines and subsequently, the presence of corresponding resistance genes was investigated by PCR. Typing results revealed that a significant proportion of the isolates belonged to serotype O78:K80, which is one of the major APEC serotypes. Phylogenetic grouping showed that phylogenetic group D was most commonly represented (n = 49). Macrorestriction analysis showed overall heterogenous results, however, some clustering of closely related isolates was observed.

Bile acids (BAs)-mediated signaling is necessary for liver regeneration, but BAs levels need to be carefully controlled to avoid hepatotoxicity. We studied the early response of the BAs-fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) axis in healthy individuals undergoing hepatectomy for living donor liver transplant.

429,Integrated transcriptome and metabolome analysis provide insights into the mechanism of saponin biosynthesis and its role in alleviating cadmium-induced oxidative damage in Ophiopogon japonicum.,"Zhe-Maidong, a cultivar of Ophiopogon japonicus is a prominent traditional herbal medicine rich in saponins. This study explored the mechanism of saponin biosynthesis and its role in alleviating Cd-induced oxidative damage in the Zhe-Maidong cultivar using three experimental groups undergoing Cd stress. In the Cd-contaminated soil treatment, total saponins were 1.68 times higher than those in the control. The saponin content in the Cd-2 and Cd-3 treatments was approximately twice as high as that in the Cd-CK treatment. These findings revealed that Cd stress leads to total saponin accumulation. Metabolomic analysis identified the accumulated saponins, primarily several monoterpenoids, diterpenoids, and triterpenoids. The increased saponins exhibited an antioxidant ability to prevent the accumulation of Cd-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Subsequent saponin application experiments provided strong evidence that saponin played a crucial role in promoting superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and reducing ROS accumulation. Transcriptome analysis revealed vital genes for saponin synthesis under Cd stress, including SE, two SSs, and six CYP450s, positively correlated with differentially expressed metabolite (DEM) levels in the saponin metabolic pathway. Additionally, the TF-gene regulatory network demonstrated that bHLH1, bHLH3, mTERF, and AUX/IAA transcript factors are crucial regulators of hub genes involved in saponin synthesis. These findings significantly contribute to our understanding of the regulatory network of saponin synthesis and its role in reducing oxidative damage in O. japonicum when exposed to Cd stress.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642440/,zhemaidong cultivar ophiopogon japonicus prominent traditional herbal medicine rich saponin study explored mechanism saponin biosynthesis role alleviating cdinduced oxidative damage zhemaidong cultivar using three experimental group undergoing cd stress cdcontaminated soil treatment total saponin time higher control saponin content cd cd treatment approximately twice high cdck treatment finding revealed cd stress lead total saponin accumulation metabolomic analysis identified accumulated saponin primarily several monoterpenoids diterpenoids triterpenoids increased saponin exhibited antioxidant ability prevent accumulation cdinduced reactive oxygen specie ro subsequent saponin application experiment provided strong evidence saponin played crucial role promoting superoxide dismutase sod activity reducing ro accumulation transcriptome analysis revealed vital gene saponin synthesis cd stress including se two ss six cyps positively correlated differentially expressed metabolite dem level saponin metabolic pathway additionally tfgene regulatory network demonstrated bhlh bhlh mterf auxiaa transcript factor crucial regulator hub gene involved saponin synthesis finding significantly contribute understanding regulatory network saponin synthesis role reducing oxidative damage japonicum exposed cd stress

431,Redox regulation of epigenetic and epitranscriptomic gene regulatory pathways in plants.,"Developmental and environmental constraints influence genome expression through complex panels of regulatory mechanisms. Epigenetic modifications and remodelling of chromatin are some of the major actors regulating the dynamic of gene expression. Unravelling the factors relaying environmental signals to gene expression reprogramming under stress conditions is an important and fundamental question. Indeed, many enzymes involved in epigenetic and chromatin modifications, are regulated by redox pathways, through post-translational modifications of proteins or by modifications of the flux of metabolic intermediates. Such modifications are potential hubs to relay developmental and environmental changes for gene expression reprogramming. In this review, we aim to update the current knowledge on the interaction between major redox mediators such as ROS, RNS and antioxidant, and epigenetic changes in plants. We will detail how redox status alters the post-translational modifications of proteins, intracellular epigenetic and epitranscriptional modifications, and how redox regulation interplays with DNA methylation, histone acetylation and methylation, miRNA biogenesis, and chromatin structure and remodelling, to reprogram genome expression under environmental constraints.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642408/,developmental environmental constraint influence genome expression complex panel regulatory mechanism epigenetic modification remodelling chromatin major actor regulating dynamic gene expression unravelling factor relaying environmental signal gene expression reprogramming stress condition important fundamental question indeed many enzyme involved epigenetic chromatin modification regulated redox pathway posttranslational modification protein modification flux metabolic intermediate modification potential hub relay developmental environmental change gene expression reprogramming review aim update current knowledge interaction major redox mediator ro rn antioxidant epigenetic change plant detail redox status alters posttranslational modification protein intracellular epigenetic epitranscriptional modification redox regulation interplay dna methylation histone acetylation methylation mirna biogenesis chromatin structure remodelling reprogram genome expression environmental constraint
432,Evolution of the FLOWERING LOCUS T-like genes in angiosperms: a core-Lamiales-specific diversification.,"Plant life-history is determined by two transitions, the germination and the flowering times, in which the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins (PEBP) FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) play key regulatory roles. Compared to the highly conserved TFL1-likes, FT-like genes vary in copy numbers significantly in gymnosperms and monocots of the angiosperms, while sporadic duplications can be observed in eudicots. Here, via a systematic analysis of the PEBPs in angiosperms with a special focus on twelve representative species featuring high-quality genomes in the Lamiales order, we identified a successive lineage-specific but systematic expansion of FT-like genes in the families of core Lamiales. The first expansion event generated FT1-likes mainly via a core-Lamiales-specific whole-genome-duplication (cL-WGD), while on the other hand, a likely random duplication produced the FT2-likes in the lineages containing Scrophulariaceae and rest of the core Lamiales. Both FT1- and FT2-like genes were further amplified tandemly in some families. These expanded FT-likes featured highly diverged expression patterns and structural variation, indicating functional diversification. Intriguingly, some core Lamiales contained the relict MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1 like 2 (MFT2) that likely expanded in the common ancestor of angiosperms. Our data showcase the highly dynamic lineage-specific expansion of the FT-like genes, thus provide important and fresh evolutionary insights into the gene-regulatory-network underpinning flowering time diversity in Lamiales, and more generally, in angiosperms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642399/,plant lifehistory determined two transition germination flowering time phosphatidylethanolaminebinding protein pebp flowering locus ft terminal flower tfl play key regulatory role compared highly conserved tfllikes ftlike gene vary copy number significantly gymnosperm monocot angiosperm sporadic duplication observed eudicots via systematic analysis pebps angiosperm special focus twelve representative specie featuring highquality genome lamiales order identified successive lineagespecific systematic expansion ftlike gene family core lamiales first expansion event generated ftlikes mainly via corelamialesspecific wholegenomeduplication clwgd hand likely random duplication produced ftlikes lineage containing scrophulariaceae rest core lamiales ft ftlike gene amplified tandemly family expanded ftlikes featured highly diverged expression pattern structural variation indicating functional diversification intriguingly core lamiales contained relict mother ft tfl like mft likely expanded common ancestor angiosperm data showcase highly dynamic lineagespecific expansion ftlike gene thus provide important fresh evolutionary insight generegulatorynetwork underpinning flowering time diversity lamiales generally angiosperm
433,Redox regulation of gene expression: proteomics reveals multiple previously undescribed redox-sensitive cysteines in transcription complexes and chromatin modifiers.,"Redox signalling is crucial for regulating plant development and adaptation to environmental changes. Proteins with redox-sensitive cysteines can sense oxidative stress and modulate their functions. Recent proteomics efforts have comprehensively mapped the proteins targeted by oxidative modifications. The nucleus, the epicentre of transcriptional reprogramming, contains a large number of proteins that control gene expression. Specific redox-sensitive transcription factors have long been recognised as key players in decoding redox signals in the nucleus and thus in regulating transcriptional responses. Consequently, the redox regulation of the nuclear transcription machinery and its cofactors has received less attention. In this review, we screened proteomic datasets for redox-sensitive cysteines on proteins of the core transcription complexes and chromatin modifiers in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our analysis indicates that redox regulation affects every step of gene transcription, from initiation to elongation and termination.

434,"Genome sequence and cell biological toolbox of the highly regenerative, coenocytic green feather alga Bryopsis.","Green feather algae (Bryopsidales) undergo a unique life cycle in which a single cell repeatedly executes nuclear division without cytokinesis, resulting in the development of a thallus (>100 mm) with characteristic morphology called coenocyte. Bryopsis is a representative coenocytic alga that has exceptionally high regeneration ability: extruded cytoplasm aggregates rapidly in seawater, leading to the formation of protoplasts. However, the genetic basis of the unique cell biology of Bryopsis remains poorly understood. Here, we present a high-quality assembly and annotation of the nuclear genome of Bryopsis sp. (90.7 Mbp, 27 contigs, N50 = 6.7 Mbp, 14 034 protein-coding genes). Comparative genomic analyses indicate that the genes encoding BPL-1/Bryohealin, the aggregation-promoting lectin, are heavily duplicated in Bryopsis, whereas homologous genes are absent in other ulvophyceans, suggesting the basis of regeneration capability of Bryopsis. Bryopsis sp. possesses >30 kinesins but only a single myosin, which differs from other green algae that have multiple types of myosin genes. Consistent with this biased motor toolkit, we observed that the bidirectional motility of chloroplasts in the cytoplasm was dependent on microtubules but not actin in Bryopsis sp. Most genes required for cytokinesis in plants are present in Bryopsis, including those in the SNARE or kinesin superfamily. Nevertheless, a kinesin crucial for cytokinesis initiation in plants (NACK/Kinesin-7II) is hardly expressed in the coenocytic part of the thallus, possibly underlying the lack of cytokinesis in this portion.

438,P2X7 receptor: a potential target for treating comorbid anxiety and depression.,"In clinical practice, depression and anxiety frequently coexist, and they are both comorbid with somatic diseases. The P2X7R is an adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-gated non-selective cation channel that is widely expressed in immune-related cells. Under conditions of stress, chronic pain, and comorbid chronic physical illness, P2X7R activation in glial cells leads to neuroinflammation. This could contribute to the development of anxiety and depression-related emotional disturbances. Previous studies have shown that the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of both anxiety and depression. Thus, the P2X7R may play a role in the comorbidity of anxiety and depression. Positron emission tomography can be used to assess the degree and location of neuroinflammation by monitoring functional and expression-related changes in P2X7R, which can facilitate clinical diagnoses and guide the treatment of patients with anxiety and depression. Moreover, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the P2X7R gene are associated with susceptibility to different types of psychiatric disorders. Thus, evaluating the SNPs of the P2X7R gene could enable personalized mood disorder diagnoses and treatments. If the P2X7R were set as a therapeutic target, selective P2X7R antagonists may modulate P2X7R function, thereby altering the balance of intra- and extra-cellular ATP. This could have therapeutic implications for treating anxiety and depression, as well as for pain management. According to in vitro and in vivo studies, the P2X7R plays an important role in anxiety and depression. In this review, we consider the potential of the P2X7R as a therapeutic target for comorbid anxiety and depression, and discuss the potential diagnostic and therapeutic value of this receptor.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642324/,clinical practice depression anxiety frequently coexist comorbid somatic disease pxr adenosine triphosphate atpgated nonselective cation channel widely expressed immunerelated cell condition stress chronic pain comorbid chronic physical illness pxr activation glial cell lead neuroinflammation could contribute development anxiety depressionrelated emotional disturbance previous study shown px receptor pxr play important role pathogenesis anxiety depression thus pxr may play role comorbidity anxiety depression positron emission tomography used ass degree location neuroinflammation monitoring functional expressionrelated change pxr facilitate clinical diagnosis guide treatment patient anxiety depression moreover single nucleotide polymorphism snp pxr gene associated susceptibility different type psychiatric disorder thus evaluating snp pxr gene could enable personalized mood disorder diagnosis treatment pxr set therapeutic target selective pxr antagonist may modulate pxr function thereby altering balance intra extracellular atp could therapeutic implication treating anxiety depression well pain management according vitro vivo study pxr play important role anxiety depression review consider potential pxr therapeutic target comorbid anxiety depression discus potential diagnostic therapeutic value receptor

440,Assessment of structural and activity-related contributions of various PIM-1 kinase inhibitors in the treatment of leukemia and prostate cancer.,"One of the most perilous illnesses in the world is cancer. The cancer may be associated with the mutation of different genes inside the body. The PIM kinase, also known as the serine/threonine kinase, plays a critical role in the biology of different kinds of cancer. They are widely distributed and associated with several biological processes, including cell division, proliferation, and death. Aberration of PIM-1 kinase is found in varieties of cancer. Prostate cancer and leukemia can both be effectively treated with PIM-1 kinase inhibitors. There are several potent compounds that have been explored in this review based on heterocyclic compounds for the treatment of prostate cancer and leukemia that have strong effects on the suppression of PIM-1 kinase. The present review summarizes the PIM-1 kinase pathway, their inhibitors under clinical trial, related patents, and SAR studies of several monocyclic, bicyclic, and polycyclic compounds. The study related to their molecular interactions with receptors is also included in the present manuscript.

441,Clinicopathologic Features and Cytologic Correlation of ALK-Rearranged Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma: A Series of Eight Cases.,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene fusions are rare in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) but may serve as a therapeutic target. This study aims to evaluate the preoperative cytologic findings and clinicopathologic features of a series of eight ALK-rearranged PTCs from our pathology archives and consultations. All cases were confirmed by ALK D5F3 immunohistochemistry and six with additional targeted RNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS). The original fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology diagnosis included the Bethesda System (TBS) category II in three (37.5%), TBS III in two (25%), TBS V in two (25%), and TBS VI in one (12.5%). Six cases had available FNA cytology and were reviewed. The cytologic features showed microfollicular architecture as well as limited or reduced nuclear elongation and chromatin alterations in all six. Nuclear grooves and pseudoinclusions were absent in two cases, rarely or focally noted in three, and frequently found in one. Two cases initially diagnosed as TBS II, showing microfollicular architecture without well-developed nuclear features, were revised to TBS III (with architectural atypia only). For histologic correlations, four were infiltrative follicular variant PTCs, three as classic subtype PTC with predominant follicular growth, and one as solid/trabecular subtype PTC. All eight cases demonstrated reduced PTC nuclear features with respect to nuclear elongation and chromatin alterations compared to those typically identified in ""BRAF-like"" PTCs. The NGS testing revealed EML4::ALK fusion in three, STRN::ALK fusion in two, and ITSN2::ALK fusion in one. In conclusion, although ALK-rearranged PTCs have been associated with neutral gene expression profile from a BRAF-RAS scoring perspective, the ""RAS-like"" nuclear features were more commonly identified in this series, resulting in frequent indeterminate diagnosis of preoperative FNA.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642308/,anaplastic lymphoma kinase alk gene fusion rare papillary thyroid carcinoma ptc may serve therapeutic target study aim evaluate preoperative cytologic finding clinicopathologic feature series eight alkrearranged ptcs pathology archive consultation case confirmed alk df immunohistochemistry six additional targeted rnabased nextgeneration sequencing ng original fineneedle aspiration fna cytology diagnosis included bethesda system tb category ii three tb iii two tb v two tb vi one six case available fna cytology reviewed cytologic feature showed microfollicular architecture well limited reduced nuclear elongation chromatin alteration six nuclear groove pseudoinclusions absent two case rarely focally noted three frequently found one two case initially diagnosed tb ii showing microfollicular architecture without welldeveloped nuclear feature revised tb iii architectural atypia histologic correlation four infiltrative follicular variant ptcs three classic subtype ptc predominant follicular growth one solidtrabecular subtype ptc eight case demonstrated reduced ptc nuclear feature respect nuclear elongation chromatin alteration compared typically identified braflike ptcs ng testing revealed emlalk fusion three strnalk fusion two itsnalk fusion one conclusion although alkrearranged ptcs associated neutral gene expression profile brafras scoring perspective raslike nuclear feature commonly identified series resulting frequent indeterminate diagnosis preoperative fna

443,Bacterial extracellular vesicles: biotechnological perspective for enhanced productivity.,"Bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) are non-replicative nanostructures released by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as a survival mechanism and inter- and intraspecific communication mechanism. Due to BEVs physical, biochemical, and biofunctional characteristics, there is interest in producing and using them in developing new therapeutics, vaccines, or delivery systems. However, BEV release is typically low, limiting their application. Here, we provide a biotechnological perspective to enhance BEV production, highlighting current strategies. The strategies include the production of hypervesiculating strains through gene modification, bacteria culture under stress conditions, and artificial vesicles production. We discussed the effect of these production strategies on BEVs types, morphology, composition, and activity. Furthermore, we summarized general aspects of BEV biogenesis, functional capabilities, and applications, framing their current importance and the need to produce them in abundance. This review will expand the knowledge about the range of strategies associated with BEV bioprocesses to increase their productivity and extend their application possibilities.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642254/,bacterial extracellular vesicle bevs nonreplicative nanostructures released gramnegative grampositive bacteria survival mechanism inter intraspecific communication mechanism due bevs physical biochemical biofunctional characteristic interest producing using developing new therapeutic vaccine delivery system however bev release typically low limiting application provide biotechnological perspective enhance bev production highlighting current strategy strategy include production hypervesiculating strain gene modification bacteria culture stress condition artificial vesicle production discussed effect production strategy bevs type morphology composition activity furthermore summarized general aspect bev biogenesis functional capability application framing current importance need produce abundance review expand knowledge range strategy associated bev bioprocesses increase productivity extend application possibility
444,The role of NF-κB in carcinogenesis of cervical cancer: opportunities and challenges.,"The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) family, consisting of several transcription factors, has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and invasion, as well as inflammatory reactions and tumor development. Cervical cancer (CC) results from long-term interactions of multiple factors, among which persistent high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection is necessary. During different stages from early to late after HPV infection, the activity of NF-κB varies and plays various roles in carcinogenesis and progress of CC. As the center of the cell signaling transduction network, NF-κB can be activated through classical and non-classical pathways, and regulate the expression of downstream target genes involved in regulating the tumor microenvironment and acquiring hallmark traits of CC cells. Targeting NF-κB may help treat CC and overcome the resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Even though NF-κB inhibitors have not been applied in clinical treatment as yet, due to limitations such as dose-restrictive toxicity and poor tumor-specificity, it is still considered to have significant therapeutic potential and application prospects. In this review, we focus on the role of NF-κB in the process of CC occurrence and hallmark capabilities acquisition. Finally, we summarize relevant NF-κB-targeted treatments, providing ideas for the prevention and treatment of CC.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642209/,nuclear factorb nfb family consisting several transcription factor implicated regulation cell proliferation invasion well inflammatory reaction tumor development cervical cancer cc result longterm interaction multiple factor among persistent highrisk human papillomavirus hrhpv infection necessary different stage early late hpv infection activity nfb varies play various role carcinogenesis progress cc center cell signaling transduction network nfb activated classical nonclassical pathway regulate expression downstream target gene involved regulating tumor microenvironment acquiring hallmark trait cc cell targeting nfb may help treat cc overcome resistance radiation chemotherapy even though nfb inhibitor applied clinical treatment yet due limitation doserestrictive toxicity poor tumorspecificity still considered significant therapeutic potential application prospect review focus role nfb process cc occurrence hallmark capability acquisition finally summarize relevant nfbtargeted treatment providing idea prevention treatment cc

446,"Comparative molecular analyses of Eimeria Schneider (Apicomplexa: Eimeriidae) species from rock ptarmigan in Iceland, Svalbard-Norway, and Japan.","The rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) has a Holarctic breeding distribution and is found in arctic and sub-arctic regions. Isolated populations and glacial relicts occur in alpine areas south of the main range, like the Pyrenees in Europe, the Pamir mountains in Central Asia, and the Japanese Alps. In recent decades considerable effort has been made to clarify parasite infections in the rock ptarmigan. Seven Eimeria spp. have been reported parasitizing rock ptarmigan. Two of those species, E. uekii and E. raichoi parasitizing rock ptarmigan (L. m. japonica) in Japan, have been identified genetically. Here we compare partial sequences of nuclear (18S rRNA) and mitochondrial (COI) genes and we detail the morphology of sporulated oocysts of E. uekii and E. raichoi from Japan, E. muta and E. rjupa, from the rock ptarmigan (L. m. islandorum) in Iceland, and two undescribed eimerian morphotypes, Eimeria sp. A, and Eimeria sp. B, from rock ptarmigan (L. m. hyperborea) in Norway (Svalbard in the Norwegian Archipelago). Two morphotypes, ellipsoidal and spheroidal, are recognized for each of the three host subspecies. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the ellipsoidal oocyst types, E. uekii, E. muta, and Eimeria sp. A (Svalbard-Norway) are identical and infects rock ptarmigan in Japan, Iceland, and Svalbard-Norway, respectively. Eimeria uekii was first described in Japan in 1981 so that E. muta, described in Iceland in 2007, and Eimeria sp. A in Svalbard-Norway are junior synonyms of E. uekii. Also, phylogenetic analysis shows that the spheroidal oocyst types, E. rjupa and Eimeria sp.

449,"Silicon supplementation stabilizes the effect of copper stress, the use of copper chaperones and genes involved: a review.","Heavy metal stress is a major problem in present scenario and the consequences are well known. The agroecosystems are heavily affected by the heavy metal stress and the question arises on the sustainability of the agricultural products. Heavy metals inhibit the process to influence the reactive oxygen species production. When abundantly present copper metal ion has toxic effects which is mitigated by the exogenous application of Si. The role of silicon is to enhance physical parameters as well as gas exchange parameters. Si is likely to increase antioxidant enzymes in response to copper stress which can relocate toxic metals at subcellular level and remove heavy metals from the cell. Silicon regulates phytohormones when excess copper is present. Rate of photosynthesis and mineral absorption is increased in response to metal stress. Silicon manages enzymatic and non-enzymatic activities to balance metal stress condition. Cu transport by the plasma membrane is controlled by a family of proteins called copper transporter present at cell surface. Plants maintain balance in absorption, use and storage for proper copper ion homeostasis. Copper chaperones play vital role in copper ion movement within cells. Prior to that metallochaperones control Cu levels. The genes responsible in copper stress mitigation are discovered in various plant species and their function are decoded. However, detailed molecular mechanism is yet to be studied. This review discusses about the crucial mechanisms of Si-mediated alleviation of copper stress, the role of copper binding proteins in copper homeostasis. Moreover, it also provides a brief information on the genes, their function and regulation of their expression in relevance to Cu abundance in different plant species which will be beneficial for further understanding of the role of silicon in stabilization of copper stress.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642191/,heavy metal stress major problem present scenario consequence well known agroecosystems heavily affected heavy metal stress question arises sustainability agricultural product heavy metal inhibit process influence reactive oxygen specie production abundantly present copper metal ion toxic effect mitigated exogenous application si role silicon enhance physical parameter well gas exchange parameter si likely increase antioxidant enzyme response copper stress relocate toxic metal subcellular level remove heavy metal cell silicon regulates phytohormone excess copper present rate photosynthesis mineral absorption increased response metal stress silicon manages enzymatic nonenzymatic activity balance metal stress condition cu transport plasma membrane controlled family protein called copper transporter present cell surface plant maintain balance absorption use storage proper copper ion homeostasis copper chaperone play vital role copper ion movement within cell prior metallochaperones control cu level gene responsible copper stress mitigation discovered various plant specie function decoded however detailed molecular mechanism yet studied review discus crucial mechanism simediated alleviation copper stress role copper binding protein copper homeostasis moreover also provides brief information gene function regulation expression relevance cu abundance different plant specie beneficial understanding role silicon stabilization copper stress

Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) has been identified as a critical mediator for primary HLH; however, the detailed role of IFNγ and other cytokines in EBV-HLH is not fully understood. In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the immune landscape of EBV-HLH and compared it with EBV-IM. Three pediatric patients with EBV-HLH with different backgrounds, one with X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome type 1 (XLP1), two with chronic active EBV disease (CAEBV), and two patients with EBV-IM were enrolled. The TUBA1B + STMN1 + CD8 + T cell cluster, a responsive proliferating cluster with rich mRNA detection, was explicitly observed in EBV-IM, and the upregulation of SH2D1A-the gene responsible for XLP1-was localized in this cluster. This proliferative cluster was scarcely observed in EBV-HLH cases. In EBV-HLH cases with CAEBV, upregulation of LAG3 was observed in EBV-infected cells, which may be associated with an impaired response by CD8 + T cells. Additionally, genes involved in type I interferon (IFN) signaling were commonly upregulated in each cell fraction of EBV-HLH, and activation of type II IFN signaling was observed in CD4 + T cells, natural killer cells, and monocytes but not in CD8 + T cells in EBV-HLH.

464,Characterization of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens PM415 as a potential bio-preserving probiotic.,"Animal feed is vulnerable to fungal infections, and the use of bio-preserving probiotics has received increasing attention. In contrast to Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria spp., fewer Bacillus spp. have been recognized as antifungal probiotics. Therefore, our objective was to screen antifungal strains and provide more Bacillus candidates to bridge this gap. Here, we screened 56 bacterial strains for cyclic lipopeptide genes and conducted an antifungal assay with Aspergillus niger as a representative fungus. We found that a Bacillus strain Bacillus amyloliquefaciens PM415, isolated from pigeon manure, exhibited the highest fungal inhibition activity as demonstrated by the confrontation assay and morphological observation under scanning electron microscope (SEM). Preliminary safety assessment and probiotic characterization revealed its non-pathogenic feature and stress tolerance capability. Whole genome sequencing of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens PM415 revealed a genome size of 4.16 Mbp and 84 housekeeping genes thereof were used for phylogenetic analysis showing that it is most closely related to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LFB112. The in silico analysis further supported its non-pathogenic feature at the genomic level and revealed potential biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for its antifungal property. RNA-seq analysis revealed genome-wide changes in transportation, amino acid metabolism, non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) biosynthesis and glycan degradation during fungal antagonism. Our results suggest that Bacillus amyloliquefaciens PM415 is a safe and effective probiotic strain that can prevent fungal growth in animal feeds.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642140/,animal feed vulnerable fungal infection use biopreserving probiotic received increasing attention contrast lactobacillus bifidobacteria spp fewer bacillus spp recognized antifungal probiotic therefore objective screen antifungal strain provide bacillus candidate bridge gap screened bacterial strain cyclic lipopeptide gene conducted antifungal assay aspergillus niger representative fungus found bacillus strain bacillus amyloliquefaciens pm isolated pigeon manure exhibited highest fungal inhibition activity demonstrated confrontation assay morphological observation scanning electron microscope sem preliminary safety assessment probiotic characterization revealed nonpathogenic feature stress tolerance capability whole genome sequencing bacillus amyloliquefaciens pm revealed genome size mbp housekeeping gene thereof used phylogenetic analysis showing closely related bacillus amyloliquefaciens lfb silico analysis supported nonpathogenic feature genomic level revealed potential biosynthetic gene cluster responsible antifungal property rnaseq analysis revealed genomewide change transportation amino acid metabolism nonribosomal peptide nrps biosynthesis glycan degradation fungal antagonism result suggest bacillus amyloliquefaciens pm safe effective probiotic strain prevent fungal growth animal feed
465,A2AR-mediated CXCL5 upregulation on macrophages promotes NSCLC progression via NETosis.,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are abundant in tumors and interact with tumor cells, leading to the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and tumor progression. Although many studies have explored the mechanisms underlying TAM polarization and its immunosuppressive functions, understanding of its progression remains limited. TAMs promote tumor progression by secreting cytokines, which subsequently recruit immunosuppressive cells to suppress the antitumor immunity. In this study, we established an in vitro model of macrophage and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell co-culture to explore the mechanisms of cell-cell crosstalk. We observed that in NSCLC, the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5) was upregulated in macrophages because of the stimulation of A2AR by adenosine. Adenosine was catalyzed by CD39 and CD73 in macrophages and tumor cells, respectively. Nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) mediated the A2AR stimulation of CXCL5 upregulation in macrophages.

The current study aimed to evaluate the value of next generation sequencing (NGS) of PeM samples in current practice. Foundation Medicine F1CDx NGS was performed on 20 tumor samples. This platform assesses 360 commonly somatically mutated genes in solid tumors and provides a genomic signature. Based on the detected mutations, potentially effective targeted therapies were identified. NGS was successful in 19 cases. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was low in 10 cases, and 11 cases were microsatellite stable. In the other cases, TMB and microsatellite status could not be determined. BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) mutations were found in 32% of cases, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A/B) and neurofibromin 2 (NF2) mutations in 16%, and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated serine/threonine kinase (ATM) in 11%. Based on mutations in the latter two genes, potential targeted therapies are available for approximately a quarter of cases (i.e., protein kinase inhibitors for three NF2 mutated tumors, and polyADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors for two ATM mutated tumors). Extensive NGS analysis of PeM samples resulted in the identification of potentially effective targeted therapies for about one in four patients.

467,A novel network-based method identifies a cuproplasia-related pan-cancer gene signature to predict patient outcome.,"Copper is a vital micronutrient involved in many biological processes and is an essential component of tumour cell growth and migration. Copper influences tumour growth through a process called cuproplasia, defined as abnormal copper-dependent cell-growth and proliferation. Copper-chelation therapy targeting this process has demonstrated efficacy in several clinical trials against cancer. While the molecular pathways associated with cuproplasia are partially known, genetic heterogeneity across different cancer types has limited the understanding of how cuproplasia impacts patient survival. Utilising RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) datasets, we generated gene regulatory networks to identify the critical cuproplasia-related genes across 23 different cancer types. From this, we identified a novel 8-gene cuproplasia-related gene signature associated with pan-cancer survival, and a 6-gene prognostic risk score model in low grade glioma. These findings highlight the use of gene regulatory networks to identify cuproplasia-related gene signatures that could be used to generate risk score models. This can potentially identify patients who could benefit from copper-chelation therapy and identifies novel targeted therapeutic strategies.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642129/,copper vital micronutrient involved many biological process essential component tumour cell growth migration copper influence tumour growth process called cuproplasia defined abnormal copperdependent cellgrowth proliferation copperchelation therapy targeting process demonstrated efficacy several clinical trial cancer molecular pathway associated cuproplasia partially known genetic heterogeneity across different cancer type limited understanding cuproplasia impact patient survival utilising rnasequencing data cancer genome atlas tcga genotypetissue expression gtex datasets generated gene regulatory network identify critical cuproplasiarelated gene across different cancer type identified novel gene cuproplasiarelated gene signature associated pancancer survival gene prognostic risk score model low grade glioma finding highlight use gene regulatory network identify cuproplasiarelated gene signature could used generate risk score model potentially identify patient could benefit copperchelation therapy identifies novel targeted therapeutic strategy
468,Comparative transcriptome and metabolite profiling reveal diverse pattern of CYP-TS gene expression during corosolic acid biosynthesis in Lagerstroemia speciosa (L.) Pers.,"Extensive leaf transcriptome profiling and differential gene expression analysis of field grown and elicited shoot cultures of L. speciosa suggest that differential synthesis of CRA is mediated primarily by CYP and TS genes, showing functional diversity. Lagerstroemia speciosa L. is a tree species with medicinal and horticultural attributes. The pentacyclic triterpene, Corosolic acid (CRA) obtained from this species is widely used for the management of diabetes mellitus in traditional medicine. The high mercantile value of the compound and limited availability of innate resources entail exploration of alternative sources for CRA production. Metabolic pathway engineering for enhanced bioproduction of plant secondary metabolites is an attractive proposition for which, candidate genes in the pathway need to be identified and characterized. Therefore, in the present investigation, we focused on the identification of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and oxidosqualene cyclases (OSC) genes and their differential expression during biosynthesis of CRA. The pattern of differential expression of these genes in the shoot cultures of L. speciosa, elicited with different epigenetic modifiers (azacytidine (AzaC), sodium butyrate (NaBu) and anacardic acid (AA)), was studied in comparison with field grown plant. Further, in vitro cultures with varying (low to high) concentrations of CRA were systematically assessed for the expression of CYP-TS and associated genes involved in CRA biosynthesis by transcriptome sequencing. The sequenced samples were de novo assembled into 180,290 transcripts of which, 92,983 transcripts were further annotated by UniProt. The results are collectively given in co-occurrence heat maps to identify the differentially expressed genes. The combined transcript and metabolite profiles along with RT-qPCR analysis resulted in the identification of CYP-TS genes with high sequence variation. Further, instances of concordant/discordant relation between CRA biosynthesis and CYP-TS gene expression were observed, indicating functional diversity in genes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642121/,extensive leaf transcriptome profiling differential gene expression analysis field grown elicited shoot culture l speciosa suggest differential synthesis cra mediated primarily cyp t gene showing functional diversity lagerstroemia speciosa l tree specie medicinal horticultural attribute pentacyclic triterpene corosolic acid cra obtained specie widely used management diabetes mellitus traditional medicine high mercantile value compound limited availability innate resource entail exploration alternative source cra production metabolic pathway engineering enhanced bioproduction plant secondary metabolite attractive proposition candidate gene pathway need identified characterized therefore present investigation focused identification cytochrome p cyp oxidosqualene cyclases osc gene differential expression biosynthesis cra pattern differential expression gene shoot culture l speciosa elicited different epigenetic modifier azacytidine azac sodium butyrate nabu anacardic acid aa studied comparison field grown plant vitro culture varying low high concentration cra systematically assessed expression cypts associated gene involved cra biosynthesis transcriptome sequencing sequenced sample de novo assembled transcript transcript annotated uniprot result collectively given cooccurrence heat map identify differentially expressed gene combined transcript metabolite profile along rtqpcr analysis resulted identification cypts gene high sequence variation instance concordantdiscordant relation cra biosynthesis cypts gene expression observed indicating functional diversity gene

470,"OsRH52A, a DEAD-Box protein, is required for embryo sac development by regulating functional megaspore specification in rice.","The development of the embryo sac is an important factor affecting seed setting in rice. Numerous genes associated with embryo sac (ES) development have been identified in plants. However, the function of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family genes on ES is poorly known in rice. Here, we characterized a rice DEAD-box protein, OsRH52A, which was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm and highly expressed in the floral organs in rice. The knockout mutant, rh52a, displayed partial ES sterility, including degenerated ES (21.0%) and the presence of double-female-gametophyte (DFG) structure (11.8%). The DFG developed from two functional megaspores (FM) near the chalazal end in one ovule, and 3.4% of DFG could fertilize via the sac near the micropylar pole in rh52a. OsRH52A was found to interact with OsMFS1 and ZIP4, both of which play a role in homologous recombination in rice meiosis. RNA-seq identified 234 down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with reproductive development, including the two genes, OsMSP1 and HSA1b, required for female germline cell specification.

472,Heavy Metals as Catalysts in the Evolution of Antimicrobial Resistance and the Mechanisms Underpinning Co-selection.,"The menace caused by antibiotic resistance in bacteria is acknowledged on a global scale. Concerns over the same are increasing because of the selection pressure exerted by a huge number of different antimicrobial agents, including heavy metals. Heavy metals are non-metabolizable and recalcitrant to degradation, therefore the bacteria can expel the pollutants out of the system and make it less harmful via different mechanisms. The selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria may be influenced by heavy metals present in environmental reservoirs. Through co-resistance and cross-resistance processes, the presence of heavy metals in the environment can act as co-selecting agents, hence increasing resistance to both heavy metals and antibiotics. The horizontal gene transfer or mutation assists in the selection of mutant bacteria resistant to the polluted environment. Hence, bioremediation and biodegradation are sustainable methods for the natural clean-up of pollutants. This review sheds light on the occurrence of metal and antibiotic resistance in the environment via the co-resistance and cross-resistance mechanisms underpinning co-selection emphasizing the dearth of studies that specifically examine the method of co-selection in clinical settings. Furthermore, it is advised that future research incorporate both culture- and molecular-based methodologies to further our comprehension of the mechanisms underlying bacterial co- and cross-resistance to antibiotics and heavy metals.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38642082/,menace caused antibiotic resistance bacteria acknowledged global scale concern increasing selection pressure exerted huge number different antimicrobial agent including heavy metal heavy metal nonmetabolizable recalcitrant degradation therefore bacteria expel pollutant system make le harmful via different mechanism selection antibioticresistant bacteria may influenced heavy metal present environmental reservoir coresistance crossresistance process presence heavy metal environment act coselecting agent hence increasing resistance heavy metal antibiotic horizontal gene transfer mutation assist selection mutant bacteria resistant polluted environment hence bioremediation biodegradation sustainable method natural cleanup pollutant review shed light occurrence metal antibiotic resistance environment via coresistance crossresistance mechanism underpinning coselection emphasizing dearth study specifically examine method coselection clinical setting furthermore advised future research incorporate culture molecularbased methodology comprehension mechanism underlying bacterial co crossresistance antibiotic heavy metal
473,An Eclectic Review on Dicarboxylic Acid Production Through Yeast Cell Factories and Its Industrial Prominence.,"Dicarboxylic acid (DCA) is a multifaceted chemical intermediate, recoursed to produce many industrially important products such as adhesives, plasticizers, lubricants, polymers, etc. To bypass the shortcomings of the chemical methods of synthesis of DCA and to reduce fossil fuel footprints, bio-based synthesis is gaining attention. In pursuit of an eco-friendly sustainable alternative method of DCA production, microbial cell factories, and renewable organic resources are gaining popularity. Among the plethora of microbial communities, yeast is being favored industrially compared to bacterial fermentation due to its hyperosmotic and low pH tolerance and flexibility for gene manipulations. By application of rapidly evolving genetic manipulation techniques, the bio-based DCA production could be made more precise and economical.

475,Biological characteristics of Cordyceps militaris single mating-type strains.,"Cordyceps militaris has been extensively cultivated as a model cordyceps species for commercial purposes. Nevertheless, the problems related to strain degeneration and breeding technologies remain unresolved. This study assessed the physiology and fertility traits of six C. militaris strains with distinct origins and characteristics, focusing on single mating-type strains. The results demonstrated that the three identified strains (CMDB01, CMSY01, and CMJB02) were single mating-type possessing only one mating-type gene (MAT1-1). In contrast, the other three strains (CMXF07, CMXF09, and CMMS05) were the dual mating type. The MAT1-1 strains sourced from CMDB01, CMSY01, and CMJB02 consistently produced sporocarps but failed to generate ascospores. However, when paired with MAT1-2 strains, the MAT1-1 strains with slender fruiting bodies and normal morphology were fertile. The hyphal growth rate of single mating-type strains (CMDB01, CMSY01, and CMJB02) typically surpassed that of dual mating-type strains (CMXF07, CMXF09, and CMMS05). The growth rates of MAT1-2 and MAT1-1 strains were proportional to their ratios, such that a single mating-type strain with a higher ratio exhibited an increased growth rate. As C. militaris matured, the adenosine content decreased.

481,"Structural basis for the recognition of α-1,6-branched α-glucan by GH13_47 α-amylase from Rhodothermus marinus.","Glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 13 is among the main families of enzymes acting on starch; recently, subfamily 47 of GH13 (GH13_47) has been established. The crystal structure and function of a GH13_47 enzyme from Bacteroides ovatus has only been reported to date. This enzyme has α-amylase activity, while the GH13_47 enzymes comprise approximately 800-900 amino acid residues which are almost double those of typical α-amylases. It is important to know how different the GH13_47 enzymes are from other α-amylases. Rhodothermus marinus JCM9785, a thermophilic bacterium, possesses a gene for the GH13_47 enzyme, which is designated here as RmGH13_47A. Its structure has been predicted to be composed of seven domains: N1, N2, N3, A, B, C, and D. We constructed a plasmid encoding Gly266-Glu886, which contains the N3, A, B, and C domains and expressed the protein in Escherichia coli. The enzyme hydrolyzed starch and pullulan by a neopullulanase-type action. Additionally, the enzyme acted on maltotetraose, and saccharides with α-1,6-glucosidic linkages were observed in the products. Following the replacement of the catalytic residue Asp563 with Ala, the crystal structure of the variant D563A in complex with the enzymatic products from maltotetraose was determined; as a result, electron density for an α-1,6-branched pentasaccharide was observed in the catalytic pocket, and Ile762 and Asp763 interacted with the branched chain of the pentasaccharide.

482,Potato miR394 targets StA/N-INVE and StLCR to negatively regulate late blight resistance.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs in eukaryotes. Plant endogenous miRNAs play pivotal roles in regulating plant development and defense responses. MicroRNA394 (miR394) has been reported to regulate plant development, abiotic stresses and defense responses. Previous reports showed that miR394 responded to P. infestans inoculation in potato, indicating that miR394 may be involved in defense responses. In this study, we further investigated its role in potato defense against P. infestans. Stable expression of miR394 in tobacco and potato enhances the susceptibility to P. infestans, which is accompanied with the reduced accumulation of ROS and down-regulation of the PTI (pattern-triggered immunity) marker genes. Besides well-known target StLCR, miR394 also targets StA/N-INVE, which encodes a chloroplast Alkaline/Neutral Invertases (A/N-INVE). Both StLCR and StA/N-INVE positively regulate late blight resistance, while miR394 degrades them. Interestingly, StA/N-INVE is located in the chloroplast, indicating that miR394 may manipulate chloroplast immunity. Degradation of StA/N-INVE may affect the chloroplast function and hence lead to the compromised ROS (reactive oxygen species) burst and reduced retrograde signaling from the chloroplast to the nucleus and cytoplasm.

Although optimal treatment regimens are available, the majority of patients with BTRE show poor resolution of symptoms. BTRE has a very complex and multifactorial etiology, which includes several influencing factors such as genetic and molecular biomarkers. Advances in multi-omics technologies have enabled to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms and related biomarkers of BTRE. Here, we reviewed multi-omics technology-based research studies on BTRE published in the last few decades and discussed the present status, development, opportunities, challenges, and prospects in treating BTRE.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38641945/,brain tumor one leading cause epilepsy brain tumorrelated epilepsy btre recognized major cause intractable epilepsy resulting huge treatment cost burden patient family society although optimal treatment regimen available majority patient btre show poor resolution symptom btre complex multifactorial etiology includes several influencing factor genetic molecular biomarkers advance multiomics technology enabled elucidate pathophysiological mechanism related biomarkers btre reviewed multiomics technologybased research study btre published last decade discussed present status development opportunity challenge prospect treating btre
484,Identifying novel disease genes and revealing the pathomechanism of monogenic diseases.,"Diseases are caused by genetic and/or environmental factors. It is important to understand the pathomechanism of monogenic diseases that are caused only by genetic factors, especially prenatal- or childhood-onset diseases for pediatricians. Identifying ""novel"" disease genes and elucidating how genomic changes lead to human phenotypes would develop new therapeutic approaches for rare diseases for which no fundamental cure has yet been established. Genomic analysis has evolved along with the development of analytical techniques, from Sanger sequencing (first-generation sequencing) to techniques such as comparative genomic hybridization, massive parallel short-read sequencing (using a next-generation sequencer or second-generation sequencer) and long-read sequencing (using a next-next generation sequencer or third-generation sequencer). I have been researching human genetics using conventional and new technologies, together with my mentors and numerous collaborators, and have identified genes responsible for more than 60 diseases. Here, an overview of genomic analyses of monogenic diseases that aims to identify novel disease genes, and several examples using different approaches depending on the disease characteristics are presented.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38641939/,disease caused genetic andor environmental factor important understand pathomechanism monogenic disease caused genetic factor especially prenatal childhoodonset disease pediatrician identifying novel disease gene elucidating genomic change lead human phenotype would develop new therapeutic approach rare disease fundamental cure yet established genomic analysis evolved along development analytical technique sanger sequencing firstgeneration sequencing technique comparative genomic hybridization massive parallel shortread sequencing using nextgeneration sequencer secondgeneration sequencer longread sequencing using nextnext generation sequencer thirdgeneration sequencer researching human genetics using conventional new technology together mentor numerous collaborator identified gene responsible disease overview genomic analysis monogenic disease aim identify novel disease gene several example using different approach depending disease characteristic presented

487,Characterization and optimization of variability in a human colonic epithelium culture model.,"Animal models have historically been poor preclinical predictors of gastrointestinal (GI) directed therapeutic efficacy and drug-induced GI toxicity. Human stem and primary cell-derived culture systems are a major focus of efforts to create biologically relevant models that enhance preclinical predictive value of intestinal efficacy and toxicity. The inherent variability in stem-cell-based cultures makes development of useful models a challenge; the stochastic nature of stem-cell differentiation interferes with the ability to build and validate reproducible assays that query drug responses and pharmacokinetics. In this study, we aimed to characterize and reduce sources of variability in a complex stem cell-derived intestinal epithelium model, termed RepliGut® Planar, across cells from multiple human donors, cell lots, and passage numbers. Assessment criteria included barrier formation and integrity, gene expression, and cytokine responses. Gene expression and culture metric analyses revealed that controlling cell passage number reduces variability and maximizes physiological relevance of the model. In a case study where passage number was optimized, distinct cytokine responses were observed among four human donors, indicating that biological variability can be detected in cell cultures originating from diverse human sources. These findings highlight key considerations for designing assays that can be applied to additional primary-cell derived systems, as well as establish utility of the RepliGut® Planar platform for robust development of human-predictive drug-response assays.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38641922/,animal model historically poor preclinical predictor gastrointestinal gi directed therapeutic efficacy druginduced gi toxicity human stem primary cellderived culture system major focus effort create biologically relevant model enhance preclinical predictive value intestinal efficacy toxicity inherent variability stemcellbased culture make development useful model challenge stochastic nature stemcell differentiation interferes ability build validate reproducible assay query drug response pharmacokinetics study aimed characterize reduce source variability complex stem cellderived intestinal epithelium model termed repligut planar across cell multiple human donor cell lot passage number assessment criterion included barrier formation integrity gene expression cytokine response gene expression culture metric analysis revealed controlling cell passage number reduces variability maximizes physiological relevance model case study passage number optimized distinct cytokine response observed among four human donor indicating biological variability detected cell culture originating diverse human source finding highlight key consideration designing assay applied additional primarycell derived system well establish utility repligut planar platform robust development humanpredictive drugresponse assay

490,EXPRESS: Relationship between Gut Microbiome and Bone Deficits in Primary Hyperparathyroidism: A Proof of Concept Pilot Study.,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) interacts with components of the gut microbiota to exert its bone-regulating effects. This study aimed to investigate the gut microbial composition in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Nine patients with PHPT and nine age-sex and body mass index-matched healthy controls were included. Gut microbial composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in both groups at baseline and one month after parathyroidectomy in the PHPT group. Data were imported into QIIME-2 and both QIIME-2 and R packages were used for microbiome analysis. Alpha and beta diversity were similar between the groups and remained unchanged after parathyroidectomy. The relative abundance of Subdoligranulum was significantly higher, whereas Ruminococcus, Alloprevotella, Phascolarctobacterium and Clostridium sensu stricto_1 were significantly lower in PHPT than in controls (p<0.001). After parathyroidectomy, the relative abundance of Subdoligranulum decreased, Ruminococcus and Alloprevotella increased (p<0.001). The PHPT group had lower total femoral and lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) than the controls (p<0.05). At baseline, Alloprevotella abundance was positively correlated with serum phosphorus and Subdoligranulum was positively correlated with total lumbar BMD. Clostridium sensu stricto_1 was negatively correlated with serum calcium and positively correlated with femoral neck BMD. Postoperatively, Alloprevotella was positively correlated with baseline serum phosphorus, and Phascolarctobacterium was positively correlated with distal radius BMD.

491,Sequential activation of strigolactone and salicylate biosynthesis promotes leaf senescence.,"Leaf senescence is a complex process strictly regulated by various external and endogenous factors. However, the key signaling pathway mediating leaf senescence remains unknown. Here, we show that Arabidopsis SPX1/2 negatively regulate leaf senescence genetically downstream of the strigolactone (SL) pathway. We demonstrate that the SL receptor AtD14 and MAX2 mediate the age-dependent degradation of SPX1/2. Intriguingly, we uncover an age-dependent accumulation of SLs in leaves via transcriptional activation of SL biosynthetic genes by the transcription factors (TFs) SPL9/15. Furthermore, we reveal that SPX1/2 interact with the WRKY75 subclade TFs to inhibit their DNA-binding ability and thus repress transcriptional activation of salicylic acid (SA) biosynthetic gene SA Induction-Deficient 2, gating the age-dependent SA accumulation in leaves at the leaf senescence onset stage. Collectively, our new findings reveal a signaling pathway mediating sequential activation of SL and salicylate biosynthesis for the onset of leaf senescence in Arabidopsis.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38641854/,leaf senescence complex process strictly regulated various external endogenous factor however key signaling pathway mediating leaf senescence remains unknown show arabidopsis spx negatively regulate leaf senescence genetically downstream strigolactone sl pathway demonstrate sl receptor atd max mediate agedependent degradation spx intriguingly uncover agedependent accumulation sl leaf via transcriptional activation sl biosynthetic gene transcription factor tfs spl furthermore reveal spx interact wrky subclade tfs inhibit dnabinding ability thus repress transcriptional activation salicylic acid sa biosynthetic gene sa inductiondeficient gating agedependent sa accumulation leaf leaf senescence onset stage collectively new finding reveal signaling pathway mediating sequential activation sl salicylate biosynthesis onset leaf senescence arabidopsis

However, existing methods for identifying spatially variable genes often focus solely on statistical significance, limiting their ability to capture continuous expression patterns and integrate spot-level covariates. To address these challenges, we introduce spVC, a statistical method based on a generalized Poisson model. spVC seamlessly integrates constant and spatially varying effects of covariates, facilitating comprehensive exploration of gene expression variability and enhancing interpretability.

494,Melatonin: a ferroptosis inhibitor with potential therapeutic efficacy for the post-COVID-19 trajectory of accelerated brain aging and neurodegeneration.,"The unprecedented pandemic of COVID-19 swept millions of lives in a short period, yet its menace continues among its survivors in the form of post-COVID syndrome. An exponentially growing number of COVID-19 survivors suffer from cognitive impairment, with compelling evidence of a trajectory of accelerated aging and neurodegeneration. The novel and enigmatic nature of this yet-to-unfold pathology demands extensive research seeking answers for both the molecular underpinnings and potential therapeutic targets. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death, is a strongly proposed underlying mechanism in post-COVID-19 aging and neurodegeneration discourse. COVID-19 incites neuroinflammation, iron dysregulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, antioxidant system repression, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) disruption, and clock gene alteration. These events pave the way for ferroptosis, which shows its signature in COVID-19, premature aging, and neurodegenerative disorders. In the search for a treatment, melatonin shines as a promising ferroptosis inhibitor with its repeatedly reported safety and tolerability. According to various studies, melatonin has proven efficacy in attenuating the severity of certain COVID-19 manifestations, validating its reputation as an anti-viral compound. Melatonin has well-documented anti-aging properties and combating neurodegenerative-related pathologies. Melatonin can block the leading events of ferroptosis since it is an efficient anti-inflammatory, iron chelator, antioxidant, angiotensin II antagonist, and clock gene regulator. Therefore, we propose ferroptosis as the culprit behind the post-COVID-19 trajectory of aging and neurodegeneration and melatonin, a well-fitting ferroptosis inhibitor, as a potential treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38641847/,unprecedented pandemic covid swept million life short period yet menace continues among survivor form postcovid syndrome exponentially growing number covid survivor suffer cognitive impairment compelling evidence trajectory accelerated aging neurodegeneration novel enigmatic nature yettounfold pathology demand extensive research seeking answer molecular underpinnings potential therapeutic target ferroptosis irondependent cell death strongly proposed underlying mechanism postcovid aging neurodegeneration discourse covid incites neuroinflammation iron dysregulation reactive oxygen specie ro accumulation antioxidant system repression reninangiotensin system ra disruption clock gene alteration event pave way ferroptosis show signature covid premature aging neurodegenerative disorder search treatment melatonin shine promising ferroptosis inhibitor repeatedly reported safety tolerability according various study melatonin proven efficacy attenuating severity certain covid manifestation validating reputation antiviral compound melatonin welldocumented antiaging property combating neurodegenerativerelated pathology melatonin block leading event ferroptosis since efficient antiinflammatory iron chelator antioxidant angiotensin ii antagonist clock gene regulator therefore propose ferroptosis culprit behind postcovid trajectory aging neurodegeneration melatonin wellfitting ferroptosis inhibitor potential treatment

501,Repetitive element transcript accumulation is associated with inflammaging in humans.,"Chronic, low-grade inflammation increases with aging, contributing to functional declines and diseases that reduce healthspan. Growing evidence suggests that transcripts from repetitive elements (RE) in the genome contribute to this ""inflammaging"" by stimulating innate immune activation, but evidence of RE-associated inflammation with aging in humans is limited. Here, we present transcriptomic and clinical data showing that RE transcript levels are positively related to gene expression of innate immune sensors, and to serum interleukin 6 (a marker of systemic inflammation), in a large group of middle-aged and older adults. We also: (1) use transcriptomics and whole-genome bisulfite (methylation) sequencing to show that many RE may be hypomethylated with aging, and that aerobic exercise, a healthspan-extending intervention, reduces RE transcript levels and increases RE methylation in older adults; and (2) extend our findings in a secondary dataset demonstrating age-related changes in RE chromatin accessibility. Collectively, our data support the idea that age-related RE transcript accumulation may play a role in inflammaging in humans, and that RE dysregulation with aging may be due in part to upstream epigenetic changes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38641753/,chronic lowgrade inflammation increase aging contributing functional decline disease reduce healthspan growing evidence suggests transcript repetitive element genome contribute inflammaging stimulating innate immune activation evidence reassociated inflammation aging human limited present transcriptomic clinical data showing transcript level positively related gene expression innate immune sensor serum interleukin marker systemic inflammation large group middleaged older adult also use transcriptomics wholegenome bisulfite methylation sequencing show many may hypomethylated aging aerobic exercise healthspanextending intervention reduces transcript level increase methylation older adult extend finding secondary dataset demonstrating agerelated change chromatin accessibility collectively data support idea agerelated transcript accumulation may play role inflammaging human dysregulation aging may due part upstream epigenetic change
502,Differences in diacylglycerol acyltransferases expression patterns and regulation cause distinct hepatic triglyceride deposition in fish.,"Triglyceride (TAG) deposition in the liver is associated with metabolic disorders. In lower vertebrate, the propensity to accumulate hepatic TAG varies widely among fish species. Diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT1 and DGAT2) are major enzymes for TAG synthesis. Here we show that large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) has significantly higher hepatic TAG level than that in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fed with same diet. Hepatic expression of DGATs genes in croaker is markedly higher compared with trout under physiological condition. Meanwhile, DGAT1 and DGAT2 in both croaker and trout are required for TAG synthesis and lipid droplet formation in vitro. Furthermore, oleic acid treatment increases DGAT1 expression in croaker hepatocytes rather than in trout and has no significant difference in DGAT2 expression in two fish species. Finally, effects of various transcription factors on croaker and trout DGAT1 promoter are studied. We find that DGAT1 is a target gene of the transcription factor CREBH in croaker rather than in trout. Overall, hepatic expression and transcriptional regulation of DGATs display significant species differences between croaker and trout with distinct hepatic triglyceride deposition, which bring new perspectives on the use of fish models for studying hepatic TAG deposition.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38641731/,triglyceride tag deposition liver associated metabolic disorder lower vertebrate propensity accumulate hepatic tag varies widely among fish specie diacylglycerol acyltransferases dgat dgat major enzyme tag synthesis show large yellow croaker larimichthys crocea significantly higher hepatic tag level rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss fed diet hepatic expression dgats gene croaker markedly higher compared trout physiological condition meanwhile dgat dgat croaker trout required tag synthesis lipid droplet formation vitro furthermore oleic acid treatment increase dgat expression croaker hepatocytes rather trout significant difference dgat expression two fish specie finally effect various transcription factor croaker trout dgat promoter studied find dgat target gene transcription factor crebh croaker rather trout overall hepatic expression transcriptional regulation dgats display significant specie difference croaker trout distinct hepatic triglyceride deposition bring new perspective use fish model studying hepatic tag deposition

504,Abundant transcriptomic alterations in the human cerebellum of patients with a C9orf72 repeat expansion.,"The most prominent genetic cause of both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a repeat expansion in the gene C9orf72. Importantly, the transcriptomic consequences of the C9orf72 repeat expansion remain largely unclear. Here, we used short-read RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to profile the cerebellar transcriptome, detecting alterations in patients with a C9orf72 repeat expansion. We focused on the cerebellum, since key C9orf72-related pathologies are abundant in this neuroanatomical region, yet TDP-43 pathology and neuronal loss are minimal. Consistent with previous work, we showed a reduction in the expression of the C9orf72 gene and an elevation in homeobox genes, when comparing patients with the expansion to both patients without the C9orf72 repeat expansion and control subjects. Interestingly, we identified more than 1000 alternative splicing events, including 4 in genes previously associated with ALS and/or FTLD. We also found an increase of cryptic splicing in C9orf72 patients compared to patients without the expansion and controls. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the expression level of select RNA-binding proteins is associated with cryptic splice junction inclusion.

505,Synthetic cationic helical polypeptides for the stimulation of antitumour innate immune pathways in antigen-presenting cells.,"Intracellular DNA sensors regulate innate immunity and can provide a bridge to adaptive immunogenicity. However, the activation of the sensors in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by natural agonists such as double-stranded DNAs or cyclic nucleotides is impeded by poor intracellular delivery, serum stability, enzymatic degradation and rapid systemic clearance. Here we show that the hydrophobicity, electrostatic charge and secondary conformation of helical polypeptides can be optimized to stimulate innate immune pathways via endoplasmic reticulum stress in APCs. One of the three polypeptides that we engineered activated two major intracellular DNA-sensing pathways (cGAS-STING (for cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase-stimulator of interferon genes) and Toll-like receptor 9) preferentially in APCs by promoting the release of mitochondrial DNA, which led to the efficient priming of effector T cells. In syngeneic mouse models of locally advanced and metastatic breast cancers, the polypeptides led to potent DNA-sensor-mediated antitumour responses when intravenously given as monotherapy or with immune checkpoint inhibitors. The activation of multiple innate immune pathways via engineered cationic polypeptides may offer therapeutic advantages in the generation of antitumour immune responses.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38641710/,intracellular dna sensor regulate innate immunity provide bridge adaptive immunogenicity however activation sensor antigenpresenting cell apc natural agonist doublestranded dna cyclic nucleotide impeded poor intracellular delivery serum stability enzymatic degradation rapid systemic clearance show hydrophobicity electrostatic charge secondary conformation helical polypeptide optimized stimulate innate immune pathway via endoplasmic reticulum stress apc one three polypeptide engineered activated two major intracellular dnasensing pathway cgassting cyclic guanosine monophosphateadenosine monophosphate synthasestimulator interferon gene tolllike receptor preferentially apc promoting release mitochondrial dna led efficient priming effector cell syngeneic mouse model locally advanced metastatic breast cancer polypeptide led potent dnasensormediated antitumour response intravenously given monotherapy immune checkpoint inhibitor activation multiple innate immune pathway via engineered cationic polypeptide may offer therapeutic advantage generation antitumour immune response
506,Extra-Skeletal Manifestations in Osteogenesis Imperfecta Mouse Models.,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare heritable connective tissue disorder of skeletal fragility with an incidence of roughly 1:15,000. Approximately 85% of the pathogenic variants responsible for OI are in the type I collagen genes, COL1A1 and COL1A2, with the remaining pathogenic OI variants spanning at least 20 additional genetic loci that often involve type I collagen post-translational modification, folding, and intracellular transport as well as matrix incorporation and mineralization. In addition to being the most abundant collagen in the body, type I collagen is an important structural and extracellular matrix signaling molecule in multiple organ systems and tissues. Thus, OI disease-causing variants result not only in skeletal fragility, decreased bone mineral density (BMD), kyphoscoliosis, and short stature, but can also result in hearing loss, dentinogenesis imperfecta, blue gray sclera, cardiopulmonary abnormalities, and muscle weakness. The extensive genetic and clinical heterogeneity in OI has necessitated the generation of multiple mouse models, the growing awareness of non-skeletal organ and tissue involvement, and OI being more broadly recognized as a type I collagenopathy.This has driven the investigation of mutation-specific skeletal and extra-skeletal manifestations and broadened the search of potential mechanistic therapeutic strategies. The purpose of this review is to outline several of the extra-skeletal manifestations that have recently been characterized through the use of genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous mouse models of osteogenesis imperfecta, demonstrating the significant potential impact of OI disease-causing variants as a collagenopathy (affecting multiple organ systems and tissues), and its implications to overall health.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38641703/,osteogenesis imperfecta oi rare heritable connective tissue disorder skeletal fragility incidence roughly approximately pathogenic variant responsible oi type collagen gene cola cola remaining pathogenic oi variant spanning least additional genetic locus often involve type collagen posttranslational modification folding intracellular transport well matrix incorporation mineralization addition abundant collagen body type collagen important structural extracellular matrix signaling molecule multiple organ system tissue thus oi diseasecausing variant result skeletal fragility decreased bone mineral density bmd kyphoscoliosis short stature also result hearing loss dentinogenesis imperfecta blue gray sclera cardiopulmonary abnormality muscle weakness extensive genetic clinical heterogeneity oi necessitated generation multiple mouse model growing awareness nonskeletal organ tissue involvement oi broadly recognized type collagenopathythis driven investigation mutationspecific skeletal extraskeletal manifestation broadened search potential mechanistic therapeutic strategy purpose review outline several extraskeletal manifestation recently characterized use genetically phenotypically heterogeneous mouse model osteogenesis imperfecta demonstrating significant potential impact oi diseasecausing variant collagenopathy affecting multiple organ system tissue implication overall health

508,Impacts of o-cresol spill on composition and function of river sediment and soil microbial communities.,"o-Cresol is a toxic substance with strong irritating and corrosive effects on skin and mucous membranes. To date, information on the effects of o-cresol on microbial communities in the natural environment is very limited. In the present study, 16S rRNA sequencing and metagenomic technique were carried out to elucidate the effects of the o-cresol spill on microbial communities in river sediments and nearby soils. o-Cresol spill induced the increase in the relative abundance of phyla Planctomycetes and Gemmatimonadetes, suggesting their resilience to o-cresol-induced stress. Uncultured Gemmatimonadetes genera and the MND1 genus exhibited enrichment, while the Pseudomonas genus dominated across all samples, indicating their potential pivotal roles in adapting to the o-cresol spill. Moreover, o-cresol spill impaired the metabolic functions of microbes but triggered their defense mechanisms. Under o-cresol pressure, microbial functions related to carbon fixation were upregulated and functions associated with sulfur metabolism were downregulated. In addition, the o-cresol spill led to an increase in functional genes related to the conversion of o-cresol to 3-methylcatechol. Several genes involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds were also identified, potentially contributing to the biodegradation of o-cresol. This study provides fresh insights into the repercussions of an abrupt o-cresol spill on microbial communities in natural environments, shedding light on their adaptability, defense mechanisms, and biodegradation potential.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38641693/,ocresol toxic substance strong irritating corrosive effect skin mucous membrane date information effect ocresol microbial community natural environment limited present study rrna sequencing metagenomic technique carried elucidate effect ocresol spill microbial community river sediment nearby soil ocresol spill induced increase relative abundance phylum planctomycetes gemmatimonadetes suggesting resilience ocresolinduced stress uncultured gemmatimonadetes genus mnd genus exhibited enrichment pseudomonas genus dominated across sample indicating potential pivotal role adapting ocresol spill moreover ocresol spill impaired metabolic function microbe triggered defense mechanism ocresol pressure microbial function related carbon fixation upregulated function associated sulfur metabolism downregulated addition ocresol spill led increase functional gene related conversion ocresol methylcatechol several gene involved degradation aromatic compound also identified potentially contributing biodegradation ocresol study provides fresh insight repercussion abrupt ocresol spill microbial community natural environment shedding light adaptability defense mechanism biodegradation potential

510,De novo reconstruction of a functional in vivo-like equine endometrium using collagen-based tissue engineering.,"To better understand molecular aspects of equine endometrial function, there is a need for advanced in vitro culture systems that more closely imitate the intricate 3-dimensional (3D) in vivo endometrial structure than current techniques. However, development of a 3D in vitro model of this complex tissue is challenging. This study aimed to develop an in vitro 3D endometrial tissue (3D-ET) with an epithelial cell phenotype optimized by treatment with a Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor. Equine endometrial epithelial (eECs) and mesenchymal stromal (eMSCs) cells were isolated separately, and eECs cultured in various concentrations of Rock inhibitor (0, 5, 10 µmol) in epithelial medium (EC-medium) containing 10% knock-out serum replacement (KSR). The optimal concentration of Rock inhibitor for enhancing eEC proliferation and viability was 10 µM. However, 10 µM Rock inhibitor in the 10% KSR EC-medium was able to maintain mucin1 (Muc1) gene expression for only a short period. In contrast, fetal bovine serum (FBS) was able to maintain Muc1 gene expression for longer culture durations. An in vitro 3D-ET was successfully constructed using a collagen-based scaffold to support the eECs and eMSCs. The 3D-ET closely mimicked in vivo endometrium by displaying gland-like eEC-derived structures positive for the endometrial gland marker, Fork headbox A2 (FOXA2), and by mimicking the 3D morphology of the stromal compartment. In addition, the 3D-ET expressed the secretory protein MUC1 on its glandular epithelial surface and responded to LPS challenge by upregulating the expression of the interleukin-6 (IL6) and prostaglandin F synthase (PGFS) genes (P < 0.01), along with an increase in their secretory products, IL-6 (P < 0.01) and prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2α) (P < 0.001) respectively. In the future, this culture system can be used to study both normal physiology and pathological processes of the equine endometrium.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38641671/,better understand molecular aspect equine endometrial function need advanced vitro culture system closely imitate intricate dimensional vivo endometrial structure current technique however development vitro model complex tissue challenging study aimed develop vitro endometrial tissue det epithelial cell phenotype optimized treatment rhoassociated protein kinase rock inhibitor equine endometrial epithelial eec mesenchymal stromal emscs cell isolated separately eec cultured various concentration rock inhibitor mol epithelial medium ecmedium containing knockout serum replacement ksr optimal concentration rock inhibitor enhancing eec proliferation viability however rock inhibitor ksr ecmedium able maintain mucin muc gene expression short period contrast fetal bovine serum fbs able maintain muc gene expression longer culture duration vitro det successfully constructed using collagenbased scaffold support eec emscs det closely mimicked vivo endometrium displaying glandlike eecderived structure positive endometrial gland marker fork headbox foxa mimicking morphology stromal compartment addition det expressed secretory protein muc glandular epithelial surface responded lp challenge upregulating expression interleukin il prostaglandin f synthase pgfs gene p along increase secretory product il p prostaglandin falpha pgf p respectively future culture system used study normal physiology pathological process equine endometrium
