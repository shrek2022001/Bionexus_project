This methodology report outlines the development of a **Biomedical Literature Mining System** designed to address challenges in retrieving and analyzing an ever-growing body of biological literature. The project aims to tackle issues like limited integration with databases, complexity of tools, data security concerns, and scalability limitations by creating a seamless, user-friendly, and secure system. The system will integrate with platforms like PubMed, offer an intuitive interface for tagging and collaboration, and ensure robust data security through encryption and role-based access controls. Scalability is achieved via cloud computing and distributed processing, enabling efficient handling of vast biomedical datasets.

Key tools include **Python** for its versatility, **NLTK** for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, **Pandas** for data manipulation, and **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for visualization. The **BERT model** is employed for text analysis, leveraging its bidirectional representation and transformer architecture for understanding context in biomedical literature. Fine-tuning BERT enables classification, information extraction, and other specific tasks. An **SQLite database** supports structured data storage, connected via an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** that defines relationships between articles, authors, keywords, and annotations.

The dataset comprises metadata from biomedical articles, including titles, abstracts, and keywords sourced from PubMed and other journals. The system addresses **information overload** and **data fragmentation** by offering enhanced retrieval capabilities and promoting standardization. Advanced search features and collaborative tools simplify literature reviews and foster interdisciplinary research. The methodology ensures that biomedical researchers can securely and efficiently analyze growing volumes of literature, bridging gaps in current systems and advancing discoveries in biomedicine.
